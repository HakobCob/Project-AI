Democratic Party chairman Tim Kaine told Meet the Press the comments were unfortunate and they were insensitive, but I think the case is closed because President Obama has spoken directly with the leader [Reid] and accepted his apology.
Members of the Republican Party have called on Reid to resign over his comments.
Party chairperson Michael Steele told Fox News Sunday There is this standard where the Democrats feel that they can say these things and they can apologize when it ... comes from the mouths of their own.
Having appeared alongside Kaine, where the Democrat Party chairman stated the case was closed, Steele argued that there was a double standard, on the basis of then-Senator Obama calling in 2002 calling for Trent Lott, at that time the majority leader, to be ousted for supporting the views of Strom Thurmond, who stood as a segregationist Presidential candidate in 1948.
The book Game Change published today, also says that New York Senator Chuck Schumer encouraged Barack Obama to run in early 2006, even though he later endorsed his former colleague Hillary Clinton.
Other revelations included that John McCain's aides were concerned about Sarah Palin's failure to understand basic facts prior to her ABC News interviews with Charles Gibson, including why North Korea and South Korea are separate countries.
Co-authors Halpern and Heileman have a history of vocal criticism of media coverage of the 2008 Presidential election.
In late 2008, Daily Kos reporter Jed Lewison drew attention to comments by Halpern, on-stage with Heilmen, asserting the reportage was, extreme bias, extreme pro-Obama coverage; he characterised election coverage as, the most disgusting failure of people in our business since the Iraq war.
Halpern's centrepiece example was an analysis of New York Times profiles on the prospective First Ladies; overlooking earlier NYT coverage that reported on Obama's Caucasian ancestors being slave owners.
ABC News anchorman Bob Woodruff and his camera operator Doug Vogt have been seriously injured in an explosion.
Early reports indicate that both men sustained head injuries in the blast.
Woodruff was evacuated to the Balad Airbase, 68 kilometers north of Baghdad and is currently undergoing surgery.
Bob and Doug are in serious condition and are being treated at a U.S. military hospital in Iraq, ABC said in a statement.
Reports say Woodruff was taping a report inside an Iraqi mechanized military vehicle near Taji, Iraq when the vehicle ran over and detonated an improvised explosive device.
ABC also reports that exchanges of small arms fire took place shortly after the explosion.
MSNBC reports that Woodruff and Vogt were wearing body armor and helmets when the explosion occurred, measures that may turn out to have saved their lives.
The Associated Press is reporting that the two men were standing in the hatch of the vehicle at the time of the explosion, and that no other people were injured.
Woodruff and Vogt had been embedded with the 4th Infantry Division that was accompanying an Iraqi Army unit.
ABC also said that both Woodruff and Vogt were wearing body armor and helmets.
The U.S. military headquarters in Baghdad has confirmed the attack took place.
Vogt, a 46-year-old Canadian based in France, is an Emmy-award winning cameraman for ABC News with 25 years of experience.
According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 61 journalists have been killed in the line of duty in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003.
Woodruff became the permanent co-anchor of ABC's World News Tonight, with Elizabeth Vargas on January 3, 2006, replacing the late Peter Jennings.
The New York Mets baseball team has agreed to a 20-year sponsorship deal with financial house Citigroup for the team's new ballpark, now called CitiField.
The deal, which includes stadium naming rights, is worth more than $20 million annually, according to a baseball official.
This tops the approximately ten million annually the NFL's Houston Texans receive from Reliant Energy to call their home Reliant Stadium.
The agreement between the Mets and the financial services company includes options for both the team and Citigroup that could extend the deal to up to 35-years.
Other commercial arrangements are part of the contract, the official said.
Construction on the ballpark, next to the current stadium in Queens, New York, began last summer and is scheduled to be ready for the 2009 season.
The Mets have played at Shea Stadium since 1964, the team's third year in the league.
The ballpark is named for William A. Shea, a lawyer who helped bring National League baseball back to New York.
The announcement will be made Monday at a special ceremony that will be attended by New York Govener, George Pataki and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Citigroup is one of the world's largest full-service banks, with two hundred million customers in more than 100 countries.
Tropical Storm Danielle is now a Category 1 hurricane, with winds up to 130 kmh (80 mph).
The storm is headed towards Bermuda and forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida expect it to strengthen over the next two days.
Hurricane Danielle is the second hurricane of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season.
The 80 kmh (50 mph) storm in the Pacific Ocean is about 210 km (130 miles) south-south west of Acapulco, Mexico.
Mexico has issued a tropical storm watch in the area.
Hurricane Danielle formed near the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of West Africa, being classified as Tropical Depression Six.
Meteorologists predict that Danielle will be the first of several storms to form within the next two weeks, as the Atlantic hurricane season is currently at its peak.
There are signs that the Atlantic is acting like it should in August and September.
We're seeing more activity than we did earlier in the season, said Rick Knabb of the Weather Channel.
Even though the 2010 season seems to be one with low activity, emergency officials are still stressing safety and awareness to residents in hurricane-prone areas.
It only takes one storm to cause a loss of lives and devastating property damage, Lauren McKeague, Florida Division of Emergency Management, says.
Hurricane Andrew was a catastrophic Category 5 storm that came during a year when it was a lower-than-average season.
In the Six Nations Cup, Ireland beat England 28 points to 24, to win The Triple Crown.
Ireland have now beaten England on the last three occasions that these sides have met.
The software watchdog group StopBadware.org, run by the Berkman Center for Internet & Society of Harvard Law School and the Oxford Internet Institute, has opened a dialogue with AOL about concerns over the presence of badware, also known as malware, in the now-free AOL 9.0 software.
Badware refers to software applications that try to download additional software with very little or no explanation.
StopBadware.org decided to investigate after their users have sent in complaints regarding the operation of the software.
According to the open inquiry on StopBadware.org, the preliminary tests conclude that AOL 9.0 installs software and Internet Explorer extensions without the consent of the user, requires users to take certain actions, and it doesn't completely uninstall itself.
The page then warns readers not to use the AOL software unless they're prepared to handle the risks involved.
The report clarifies its charges; for example it lists RealPlayer, QuickTime, AOL You've Got Pictures Screensaver, Pure Networks Port Magic, and Viewpoint Media Player as the software that is installed without notification.
Additionally, the AOL toolbar, a bookmark to AOL.com, as well as extra icons are added to Internet Explorer without consent.
The report continues by noting that AOL coerces users into upgrading the software by a popup window that does not allow refusal, as well as automatically upgrades the software without allowing that option to be disabled.
AOL spokesman Andrew Weinstein claims that these problems are going to be addressed in an upgrade available next month.
In the meantime, Weinstein claims that the problems are not malicious.
No one has done more to protect users from malware than AOL, Weinstein said.
John Palfrey agrees that the findings of AOL are not the worst he's seen, but they should disclose more information about the software to users.
When AOL was issued with an advance copy of the report, StopBadware.org was very impressed with their response, and that they look forward to working with AOL.
In the biggest ever narcotics haul in India's capital, the New Delhi police have seized over 4,400 kg of Mandrax and Rs. 20 crore from a dealer in the city.
The consignment, meant for a customer in the U.S, was seized from a godown in Badarpur, near the Delhi-Haryana border.
The alleged trafficker, identified as Vinod Sharma, claimed that the contraband was not his and that he had nothing to do with the matter.
Sharma started his career as a scrap-dealer in Delhi, and police suspect that with the help of some contacts he used container depots for drug-trafficking, whilst successfully dodging both the police and the Customs Department.
On Sunday the Delhi Police arrested him at his Kalkaji residence.
The Deputy Commissioner of Police for South District, Delhi Police, Anil Shukla said, Sharma befriended container drivers and once they had driven past customs, he and his men would meet them at a distance and pilfer the containers.
An International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) spokesman in Washington revealed Wednesday it had documented and reported to the United States credible information concerning desecration of the Koran by Guantanamo Bay personnel between January 2002 and January 2003.
The ICRC rarely discloses publicly the contents of the confidential reports it gives to governments.
Simon Schorno, Red Cross spokesman, said the ICRC's concerns were mentioned multiple times to Pentagon officials in their reports.
ICRC delegates have had access to Guantanamo Bay detainees since 2002 and have compiled and corroborated independent reports from detainees about desecration of the Koran numerous times to Guantanamo Bay commanders and Pentagon officials, said Mr. Schorno.
The ICRC representatives never observed any such incidents themselves, however.
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman, acknowledged that allegations were made on rare occasions but were uncorroborated.
Mr. Schorno disputed the Pentagon's denial saying, All information we received were corroborated allegations.
He added that, We certainly corroborated mentions of the events by detainees themselves, and that the ICRC considers such reports very seriously, and very carefully, and [we] document everything.
The reports ceased after January 19, 2003, when the Defense Department issued three pages of guidelines on proper treatment of Korans, according to Mr. Schorno.
On Wednesday Mr. Schorno gave credit for addressing the issue, saying, We brought it up to the attention of the authorities, and it was followed through.
Some Muslim news agencies are still reacting to last week's Newsweek article alleging Korans had been thrown into Guantanamo Bay toilets.
The Jordanian newspaper Al-Dustur reported that some Middle Eastern TV stations were broadcasting images of Korans shredded by US forces in one Iraqi mosque.
New York-based Human Rights Watch special counsel Reed Brody said Wednesday that the White House's response to Newsweek's report of the desecrations should be fully investigated and that those who ordered or condoned this abuse, [should] not attack those who have tried to report on it.
However, Scott McClellan explained in a press conference last Tuesday that the White House is not trying to tell Newsweek what to print.
McClellan said, Look, this report caused serious damage to the image of the United States abroad.
We appreciate the step that they took by retracting the story.
Now we would encourage them to move forward and do all that they can to help repair the damage that has been done by this report.
But, no, you're absolutely right, it's not my position to get into telling people what they can and cannot report.
The Council of Europe is pressing member governments to provide information concerning CIA prisons operating secretly in Europe.
In an interim report by the human rights council rapporteur, Swiss senator Dick Marty made public the 42-member nation's preliminary conclusions regarding CIA activity on European Union soil.
Marty reported, Individuals have been abducted, deprived of their liberty and transported to different destinations in Europe, to be handed over to countries in which they have suffered degrading treatment and torture.
The report estimates the rendition of more than a hundred persons.
But when it comes right down to it, no irrefutable evidence exists to confirm allegations that the CIA operated secret detention centers in Europe.
There is a great deal of coherent, convergent evidence pointing to the existence of a system of 'relocation' or 'outsourcing of torture', the report stated while further noting that, It is highly unlikely that European governments, or at least their intelligence services, were unaware.
Our aim is to find out the truth that is being hidden from us today, he said.
He adds that he is afraid of the pressure put on the media in the United States not to report on this affair.
A researcher for Human Rights Watch, John Swift, said; Cooperation is going to be needed if this investigation is going to succeed.
They can decide to cooperate with this investigation and uphold European traditions of human rights, or they can continue their romance with the CIA.
The report has also been criticized for appearing to lack new content and to be incomplete.
Former minister for Europe and British member of parliament Denis MacShane has said that Marty's report has more holes than a Swiss cheese.
US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack has rejected the report and stated that it was an example of the same old reports wrapped up in some new rhetoric.
US Department of Homeland Security secretary Michael Chertoff has stated regarding the US government that the government acts in accordance with the law and with respect to the sovereignty of host countries in which it operates, and further stated that The authorities are free to investigate what they want to investigate but we should not allow ourselves to be distracted from the need to identify, prevent and protect against terrorist acts of violence.
The group Amnesty International USA is calling for the US Congress to create a commission to investigate detention and interrogation practices.
The United States neither confirms nor denies the existence of secret detention centers.

The Co-operative Group (Co-op) and Bristol-based Somerfield today agreed on a deal worth Â£1.565 billion which results in Somerfield being acquired by Co-op.
Co-op has said that the acquisition took place on a cash-free debt-free basis.
Peter Marks, chief executive of The Co-operative Group, claimed that this is good news for consumers and for competition in the grocery market, where we will create a stronger fifth player in food and a convenience store chain with unrivalled geographic reach.
He then said that for The Co-operative Group this is a transformational deal â€“ cementing our position as the UKâ€™s premier community retailer and helping us significantly as we lead a renaissance of The Co-operative brand.
Paul Mason, chair of privately-held Somerfield, also commented on the takeover.
The Co-operative Group and Somerfield have a similar focus in terms of customers, store types, product ranges and business vision.
Our shared vision of providing a high-quality and affordable convenience offer to local communities means that together we will be twice as strong, and therefore twice as able to deliver the local grocery shops British customers demand, he said.
With 4.4% share of the market, the Co-op is the fifth largest grocery chain in the UK.
The owners of Somerfield made their wish to sell the company clear in January of this year.
Co-op first expressed an interest in the purchase in April.
BBC News Online reported that the Competition Commission may force Co-op to sell some stores due to its increased presence.
The Montreal Heart Institute (MHI) notified the public, through a news release Wednesday, that a recent high volume of patients has put a strain on the hospital's resources.
The MHI requested that the public avoid its emergency department and find alternate care, if possible.
It did indicate that acute care emergency patients would not be turned away.
The notice was to be in place for 24 hours from Wednesday.
On Thursday, the MHI issued a extension to the public notice for an additional 24-hour period.
The number of patients that visited the MHI over the past few months had been abnormally high and reached a peak in the past two weeks, according to the head of emergency services.
Alain Vadeboncoeur indicated that it was unusual for the MHI to put out such an advisory, but assured the public that the hospital would always take the big emergencies.
The hospital treats 45 to 50 emergency patients per day, typically, but that number jumped to as many as 70 patients per day in the past two weeks.
The MHI maintains 153 beds, including 42 in medical intensive care and 29 in surgical intensive care and performs 1,850 cardiac surgeries yearly.
It was suggested by the MHI that people requiring non-emergency care contact their regional Info-SantÃ© for telephone-based advice, or visit a local clinic.
Founded in 1954, the MHI specializes in cardiovascular treatment, with an emphasis on prevention, specialized care, research, and assessment of new technologies.
The MHI is a teaching facility affiliated with the University of Montreal.
American-based online retailer Amazon.com has backtracked from its July decision and actions to remotely delete George Orwell's classic dystopian novels, Nineteen Eighty-Four and Animal Farm, from customers' Kindle e-book readers.
Late Thursday, Amazon emailed owners of Kindle readers who had previously lost copies of these novels, offering a new copy of the deleted books, or a gift certificate or check for US$30.
In the email, the company's chief executive, Jeff Bezos apologised again, and described the earlier actions as stupid, thoughtless and painfully out of line with our principles.
Initially, the two works of Orwell were made available to Kindle owners by a third-party company which did not have the rights to distribute them.
When Amazon was alerted to this by the actual rights holder, the company removed the books from their online store then, far more controversially, remotely deleted the books from their customers' devices before issuing refunds.
In the aftermath of significant press coverage of Amazon's actions to remove content, legal action was started against them in Washington alleging violations of the company's published terms of service, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and Washington's consumer protection legislation.
A Michigan student named as a plaintiff in the case explained that the deletion of his copy of 1984 had rendered his annotations and notes worthless.
First published in 1949, the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four will not enter the public domain in the United States until 2044.
The president of Niger, Tandja Mamadou, has been captured and imprisoned by a group of Nigerien soldiers under the name of Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy after an attack on the presidential palace late Thursday.
The Nigerien embassy in London has issued a statement saying that both the president and ministers in his company were safe and well, although officials said that the company was most likely imprisoned in military barracks outside of Niamy.
According to an announcement by the representative of the group responsible for the coup, a Nigerien Army colonel, the country's constitution has been suspended and all government institutions have been dissolved.
It is not clear who the leader of the coup is, although several military sources said that Major Adamou Harouna of the Nigerien Army was responsible.
The coup apparently took place during a cabinet meeting in the capitol building, and was preceded by a several-hour long gun battle in the capital, Niamy.
The battle began at about 1300 local time (1200 UTC), ending about four hours later, with both foot soldiers and tanks involved, although no significant deployment of the military was reported.
The morning after the battle, the streets were relatively quiet, and the only significant military presence is heavy artillery around the presidential palace.
The battle led to at least ten deaths, four of which were soldiers.
Additionally, a curfew has been imposed, and the military has closed Niger's borders.
Despite the crisis, the government has yet to release an official statement as to its status.
The actions of the military prompted condemnations of the coup from both the African Union and the nation of France, both of which called for negotiations to resolve the situation.
The West African group of countries Ecowas has already dispatched a delegation to talk to the group responsible for the coup.
The coup came after an extended political crisis in which President Tandja has dissolved both the National Assembly and Niger's High Court, as well as extending his presidential term by three years, and removing all further limits on his term.
These actions have led to increasing pressure against him and the government, culminating with a thousands-strong demonstration against the government last week.
Serial killer Michael Ross appeared before a Connecticut court today, and told Judge Patrick Clifford that he wanted to die.
If executed, Ross will be the first person put to death in Connecticut in over 40 years.
Ross admitted to killing eight women in Connecticut and New York in the 1980s, and to raping several of them.
The hearing considered whether Ross, who holds a degree in economics from Cornell University, was mentally competent to waive his appeals.
Dr. Michael Norko, appointed by the court to examine Ross, testified that Ross is a sexual sadist and is prone to depression.
Ross had attempted suicide three times in the past, Norko told the court, but he is not suicidal now.
Norko further testifed that Ross is taking medication to control his psychiatric problems.
Norko testified that Ross made a rational decision in electing to waive his appeals, and the court agreed, finding Ross clear headed and well educated.
This decision is his right to make, Judge Clifford said from the bench.
However, Ross' father and the Connecticut Public Defender's Office have filed motions in Rockville Superior Court claiming that Ross suffered from mental delusions at the time of his orignial trial, and that his previous attorneys did a poor job defending him.
There is no word when the Rockville court will rule.
James Hipwell, a former financial reporter for the Daily Mirror tabloid, told the Leveson Inquiry today he believed hacking into voicemails of celebrities and others was a bog-standard tool for entertainment journalists at the Mirror.
Hipwell was fired from the paper in 2000 and then convicted and sent to prison in February 2006 for using his City Slicker column in the newspaper to write about companies he had a financial stake in, which netted him approximately Â£40,000.
Trinity Mirror newspapers, which publishes the Mirror, also publishes another tabloid The People which is also alleged to have used phone hacking to get stories.
Hipwell told the inquiry he believed that voicemail hacking was genuinely accepted, happened every day and was entirely accepted by the senior editors on the newspaper and that it was seen as a slightly underhand thing to do but not illegal.
Hipwell's testimony contradicts claims by the former editor of the Mirror, Piers Morgan, who now hosts a talk show on CNN.
Morgan claims that under his editorship, he was unaware of any hacking, but Hipwell claims it is unlikely Morgan did not know about hacking going on at the paper.
The Leveson Inquiry was set up by the British Prime Minister David Cameron following the scandal which engulfed the News of the World after widespread allegations they hacked into voicemails of crime victims and their families including the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, and has so far interviewed numerous representatives of the media industry, and alleged victims of press intrusion and phone hacking.
The United States and Russia yesterday agreed to the swap of prisoners held by both nations after eleven Russian spies were arrested late last month.
The swap will include the ten Russian spies arrested on US soil (the eleventh was arrested in Cyprus and subsequently escaped) and four spies being held in Russia on charges of espionage.
The spies arrested by the US all pled guilty to charges of conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of a foreign country.
Below are the Russian spies who were convicted (cover names are in quotes, while real names are unquoted)Richard and Cynthia Murphy Vicky Paleaz Juan Lazaro Anna Chapman Mikhail Zemenko Michael Zottoli and Patricia Mills Donald Howard Heathfield and Tracy Lee Ann Foley
The swap reportedly began late yesterday, with Russia beginning the process of releasing at least one of the prisoners they held, Igor Sutyagin, almost immediately.
Russian media reported that he had already arrived in Vienna, Austria, although his father said that it was so far unconfirmed.
Russia has so far not confirmed the identities of other prisoners to be released, although several names have been speculated, including Alexander Zaporozhsky, Sergei Skripal, and Alexander Sypachev, all accused of transferring information to foreign governments.
The US arrested the ten spies that are to be returned to Russia as part of its breakup of a long-term spy ring that had operated for years, and involved the spies living as American civilians, some as couples.
Prosecutors say that they had been commanded by Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, with the mission of collecting information about American policy.
The tsunami caused by Japan's magnitude 8.9 quake on Friday destroyed the commercial fishing harbor of Crescent City, California, a coastal town still recovering from a devastating tsunami in 1964.
Although most of the fishing boats were removed in advance, the 198 docking slips that the harbor had provided for boats, enabling the livelihoods of the fishing crews, were lost.
We're facing not only physical but financial disaster, he said during a briefing.
Our business activity came to a screeching halt yesterday, and that affects the entire community.
Councilwoman Kelly Schellong said, This is going to have a trickle-down effect beyond the lost jobs.
Crescent City's unemployment rate was 13 percent before Friday's tsunami destroyed its commerical fishing industry.
The 1964 tsunami that hit Crescent City killed 11, demolished the harbor and heavily damaged large portions of the business district.
Although the city subsequently rebuilt, another tsunami again damaged the harbor in 2006.
The city was in the midst of reconstructing the harbor when Friday's tsunami hit.
The harbor is surrounded by land and a breakwater built after the 1964 disaster.
The tsunami's huge waves entered through a small opening provided for the entrance and exit of boats.
Lori Dengler, director of the Humboldt Earthquake Education Center, says Friday's tsunami was one of as many as 38 tsunamis to strike Crescent City within the last 78 years.
She calls the city a tsunami magnet because of the topography of the ocean floor that contributes to its vulnerability.
She also blames the breakwater built after the 1964 tsunami because it traps tsunami waves in the harbor, causing them to boil and churn.
A county supervisor found the view painful on Saturday as she surveyed the wreckage accompanied by state officials.
The Centre for Independent Studies has released a paper calling for reform of university student fees system.
The paper, authored by Andrew Norton, argues that the cap on loans to full fee paying students is too low.
The current cap allows for loans during a lifetime of AU$50,950.
Setting the FEE-HELP limit at this amount biases the market against courses that are long or have high per year costs, or both, argues Norton in the paper.
The loan cap is a crude way of controlling lending, taking no account of course costs or capacity to repay.
He argues that the system should function more like commercial lending.
A truly radical reform would make student loans mimic commercial loans students with good earning prospects could borrow large sums, other students could borrow less, and some could not borrow at all, he said.
Instead of denying or limiting loans to people doing high cost courses, as now occurs, the government could deny loans to people who are unlikely to repay.
The paper was criticised by Senator Kerry Nettle, Education Spokesperson for the Australian Greens.
She argued that the changes would mean an increase in costs to students already struggling to pay, and called on Education Minister Julie Bishop to rule out the changes.
To consider refusing loans to those deemed less able to repay would further cut off higher education for Australians from low socio-economic backgrounds, she said.
Julie Bishop should use her address to the National Press Club tomorrow to rule out any moves to further deregulate the HECS system.
Student fees have spiralled upward under the Howard government and any further deregulation would just make a bad system worse, she added.
After an exhaustive two year, 20 million euro ($28 million) search, the final resting spot of Air France Flight 447 has been located.
The location of the wreckage is six miles north of the plane's last reported position off the coast of Brazil at a depth of 3,800 and 4,000 meters (2,070 to 2,190 fathoms or 12,467 feet and 13,123 feet).
The wreckage of the Airbus A330-200, was found Sunday by a team from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, using a Remus robotic submarine and its side-scan sonar.
After the wreckage was found, another Remus robot submarine with cameras was sent down to the site, where it filmed bodies in the wreckage.
Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, France's Ministry of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and Sea, confirmed to reporters Bodies were found.
We are now confronted with another trauma, Robert Soulas, vice president of Entraide et SolidaritÃ© AF447, a support group for families of victims of the crash, said.
Soulas lost his daughter and son-in-law, who were on board the flight when it crashed.
For me, personally I would like to leave the bodies of my children, my two children, on the seabed.
The remains of the plane, which were concentrated in a 600 metres by 200 metres (1,968 feet by 656 feet) area, appear to be relatively intact which leads investigators to believe that the plane hit the water intact and did not explode mid-air.
Around 50 bodies of the 228 passengers and crew on board and parts of the plane were found shortly after the crash in 2009.
According to Jean-Paul Troadec, the head of France's Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA), the accident investigation body for aircraft overseeing the operation and investigation, the wreckage and bodies will be bought to surface and then sent to France for investigation.
The salvage operation, which will cost around 5 million euros ($7.1 million) according to estimates, will be financed by the French government.
Three salvage companies who are bidding to recover the wreck have until afternoon on Thursday to submit proposals.
The operation should take between three weeks to a month.
On raising the remains of the plane Troadec said We want to know what happened in this accident, most particularly so it never happens again.
Some family members agreed saying such as Michael Gaignard, whose sister was on board the plane said, We want to know what happened in that plane.
An attorney for several families said some had yet to come to terms with loss of loved ones, saying There's been no burial, no goodbye ... just lots and lots of suffering.
However, despite the discovery of the wreckage, the plane's two flight recorders, the flight data recorder (FDR) and the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) have yet to be found at the crash site.
Alain Bouillard, who is in charge of BEA's recovery effort said, It's still a jigsaw puzzle.
There are concerns that the two-year length the recorders have been submerged in seawater along with enormous pressure located at the depth of the wreck, that the data on the recorders might be unreadable.
Bouillard said it is possible the recorders were damaged, but had great confidence in their robustness.
Without the recovery of the recorders, investigators may be unable to determine the cause of the crash.
The leading theory at the moment is that the crew received incorrect air speed readings from the aircraft's pitot tubes, devices which measure how fast the aircraft is travelling.
Experts say the tubes may have become iced over, causing the crash.
The plane's Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) sent out 24 messages over a four-minute long period stating numerous problems and warnings, including incorrect air speed warnings occurring aboard the aircraft, just prior to it going down.
Archaeologists Timothy Darvill of Bournemouth University and Geoff Wainwright, President of the Society of Antiquaries, claimed to have found evidence that Stonehenge was once a center of healing.
In an excavation conducted at the site, a large number of human remains were found that display signs of physical injury or disease.
Study of the teeth from the skeletons indicates that about half of them were from outside the area.
A large number of bluestone or spotted Preseli dolerite chips found during the excavation led the researchers to conclude the stones were venerated for their healing properties.
It is believed that about 80 of such bluestone blocks were transported from the Preseli Hills in Pembrokeshire, Wales to the Salisbury plains.
The inner circle of bluestones are the earliest stone structures found in this site.
Later bluestones were encircled by the imposing sandstone monoliths of sarsen stones.
It could be that people were flaking off pieces of bluestone, in order to create little bits to take away... as lucky amulets, said Professor Darvill.
Radiocarbon dating indicates that the original bluestone circle was built around 2300 BC.
This date coincides with the burial of Amesbury Archer, whose tomb was discovered near Stonehenge.
The skeleton of this man reveals that he had serious knee injury and tooth problems.
Researchers therefore conclude that the Archer came to Stonehenge to be healed.
Dating of charcoal fragments revealed that the site was inhabited as early as 7200 BC by groups of hunter-gatherers.
This is more than 3500 years earlier than previously known.
London, England â€” The Australia national wheelchair rugby team defeated Canada 66â€“51 to win Australia's last gold medal of the 2012 Summer Paralympics.
The Canadian team had no answer to Ryley Batt, who scored 37 goals.
Before the game he skylarked by riding his wheelchair on one wheel.
The commentator called him Houdini for escaping any attempt to restrain him.
He did share the ball with the rest of the team.
By contrast, the Australian defenders held Canada's Garett Hickling to just seven goals.
At one point two Australian defenders trapped him in a corner, unable to move, which he appeared to find very frustrating.
Spectators included the Australian Chef de Mission, Jason Hellwig, and his deputies, Michael Hartung and Kate McLoughlin.
The rugby team's gold medal brought Australia's count to 32, and the total medals to 85, putting Australia in fifth place.
The team's gold medals were presented by HRH The Earl of Wessex.
Bertha became the first hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season Monday, after strengthening from a tropical storm overnight.
As of 1100 am EDT, the Category 1 hurricane is located in the mid-Atlantic ocean, about 775 miles east of the Leeward Islands, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida.
It has maximum sustained winds of 90 miles per hour, with higher gusts, and it is moving west-northwest at 15 miles per hour.
The storm is expected to strengthen over the next 24 hours, with a possibility of intensifying into a Category 2 hurricane later today.
The National Hurricane Center sees no apparent environmental factors to inhibit Bertha's intensification into a Category 2 storm.
Over the next few days, it is projected to gradually turn towards the northwest, while reducing in forward speed.
The National Hurricane Center has not said whether Bertha will affect any land areas.
However, a five-day forecast map shows Bertha passing near Bermuda around Saturday.
While the degree of the turn has important implications regarding potential impacts to Bermuda, the National Hurricane Center said, it is much too early to determine if Bertha will actually threaten that island.
Coincidentally, Bertha was also the name of a 1996 hurricane, which formed exactly 12 years ago on July 7.
Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) and mobile phone company O2 have said they intend to open London's Millennium Dome as a concert arena in April 2007.
The 365 m diameter dome was built in the 1990s for the year 2000 celebrations and is the largest single-roof structure in the world.
After hosting an exhibition for 2000, the dome has mostly laid empty.
The building, to be renamed the O2, will contain a 23,000 seat arena, an 1,800 seat theatre and a 2,200 capacity night club.
Afghan government officials have said that a powerful suicide car bomb hit near the Indian Embassy in Kabul on Thursday, killing at least 17 people and wounding more than 80 others.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the blast, saying their target was the embassy.
The Afghan Interior Ministry says the explosion killed mostly civilians on the heavily guarded road between its headquarters and the Indian Embassy.
Eyewitnesses reports said that the the blast was very powerful, shattering shop windows, filling the air with dust and scattering debris all along the road.
General Sayed Abdul Ghafar Sahibzada, the Kabul police chief, said the suicide bomber exploded his vehicle in the center of the capital.
Thursday's blast comes one day after the eighth anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion into Afghanistan to topple the Taliban government.
Last year, a similar attack by a Taliban suicide car bomber killed about 60 people near the Indian embassy.
It was the deadliest assault in the capital since 2001.
Recently elected Markham, Ontario MPP Michael Chan became Ontario's Revenue Minister today to reflect the large Chinese-Canadian community.
Former Ontario NDP premier Bob Rae created the revenue ministry.
Liberal premier Dalton McGuinty recreated it because he wanted Chan in it.
He also said that Finance Minister Greg Sorbara needs a hand with his job and this would help.
Michael is a strong member of our team and brings a great deal of experience to this position, McGuinty said today.
Michael is passionate about building opportunity for Ontario families and we're happy to have him on the team.
Before getting in power, Chan owned an insurance brokerage in Markham with hundreds of agents.
Chan won on February 8 and was just sworn in two days ago.
At 453 p.m. (EDT), Space Shuttle Discovery took off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on its final mission, STS-133.
Its mission is to deliver and install onto the International Space Station (ISS), the Permanent Multipurpose Module Leonardo, the ExPRESS Logistics Carrier-4 and provide critical spare components for the station.
Six astronauts, Steve Lindsey, Eric Boe, Alvin Drew, Nicole Stott, Michael Barratt, and Steve Bowen, are participating in the mission.
The shuttle is also carrying Robonaut2, the first dexterous humanoid robot to be in space.
Although its first priority will be to test its operation in microgravity, upgrades could eventually allow it to fulfill its ultimate purpose of becoming an astronaut helper on boring or dangerous tasks.
The launch of Discovery, which was supposed to occur at 450 p.m., was delayed for three minutes due to a technical problem in the shuttle's command system and a chipped heat shield tile near the crew hatch which needed to be patched.
The launch was also repeatedly postponed since November 1 due to various technical problems with the shuttle's systems and a hydrogen leak in the fuel tank along with cracks and bad weather.
A small piece of foam broke off during the launch but NASA has reported that it is unlikely to cause problems.
Discovery and the crew of STS-133 are scheduled to spend about two weeks in space and aboard the ISS, logging 4.5 million additional miles of flight.
The launch comes just hours after an unmanned automated European cargo spacecraft, ATV-2, docked with the orbiting outpost to deliver supplies and equipment to the crew.
STS-133 is scheduled to be the final mission of Discovery, with its first being STS-41-D in 1984.
Discovery flew 39 flights in its operational history, including the current mission, delivering several payloads to space including the Hubble Space Telescope and visiting two different space stations Mir and the ISS.
STS-133 is the 133rd shuttle mission and the 35th mission to the ISS.
Discovery is the oldest surviving shuttle, and has flown more missions than any other shuttle.
It was also the first shuttle to fly after the Challenger disaster and was the first shuttle to fly after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.
Later, Discovery became the first shuttle to fly a Russian cosmonaut.
After the current mission, there will be at most two remaining shuttle flights.
Endeavor has one more mission remaining, and if an emergency rescue is needed or more funding is secured, Atlantis will also fly once more before the entire fleet is retired.
The shuttle has provided an amazing capacity for this country to gather data.
I think weâ€™re still sorting through a lot of it, trying to figure out what all weâ€™ve learned from it.
This chapter in our space history known as the space shuttle has been incredible, said Bryan Lunney, lead space shuttle flight director for the mission.
Kabul Afghanistan saw the worst violence on Monday since the fall of the Taliban, after a large U.S. Military cargo truck crashed into about a dozen vehicles at an intersection in Kabul killing at least 7 civilians and injuring about 40.
There was a traffic jam and all the vehicles were stopped, said one witness, 21-year old shopkeeper Mohammad Wali.
The American convoy hit all the vehicles which were on the way.
A U.S. military spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Paul Fitzpatrick, said no U.S. troops had been hurt, and that an investigation has begun into the incident.
The U.S. military also said the crash was caused by brake failure but Afghans often complain about aggressive driving tactics of the U.S. military.
Convoys often pass through crowded areas at high speed and occasionally disregard road rules.
U.S. military says such driving is necessary to protect the troops from attack.
Afghan rioters also claimed U.S. troops had shot and killed civilians at the scene of the accident.
Chanting Death to America, rioters stoned the U.S. convoy involved in the accident Monday before heading to the center of Kabul where they ransacked offices of international aid groups and searched for foreigners.
Smoke billowed from burning buildings along the path of destruction.
Royal Mail workers have voted 31 in favour of a nationwide postal strike in the United Kingdom.
The Communication Workers' Union (CWU), that represents employees of the postal service balloted members on nationwide strike action, following a series of regional strikes over the past 3 weeks.
Of the 80,830 members consulted, 61,623 voted in favour of a walk-out.
The union's General Secretary, Dave Ward, said that there would be no strike action for at least 10 days.
The possibility of further talks with the Royal Mail before undertaking action has not be ruled out; any walk-outs in the run-up to Christmas will cause extreme disruption to deliveries.
New South Wales Police have broadened investigations into Australia's oldest Catholic boarding school, St Stanislaus College in Bathurst, New South Wales, following claims that at least 13 men were sexually abused while children at the school in the 1970s and 1980s.
The claims have surfaced following police being alerted in August last year.
Police have appealed for victims to come forward, but acknowledged it may be difficult for some.
I would imagine it would be very hard for anyone subject to these sort of things to come forward, Detective Superintendent Michael Goodwin said.
All I can say is that NSW police force will be providing every form of support we possibly can to make the process for them as trouble-free as possible.
Superintendent Goodwin reassured the community that the allegations date back two decades and there is absolutely no suggestion whatsoever that the college involved ishas been looking to anything in the current day.
The college involved has been cooperating with the police completely with this inquiry, Goodwin added.
The police would not release how many suspects were being investigated but said their inquiries had not led them to any other locations where former staff may have been employed.
Superintendent Goodwin said Police were exploring all lines of enquiry and that no loose ends [are] being let go at this stage.
The school's principal, John Edwards, said the police had served him with a search warrant last month which listed the names of three former staff members.
There were three former staff member who were listed on the search warrant that was served on me in early July, and we facilitated the gathering of material for police, Mr Edwards told Fairfax Radio Network.
Mr Edwards called for the matter to be transparent and described the complaints as gravely concerning and he hopes they are properly dealt with by the courts.
It is absolutely a requirement for this matter to be open, for this matter to be addressed and this matter to be resolved, he said.
This school is very concerned to ensure that children are treated well and that their interests are protected.
A former priest, Brian Joseph Spillane, aged 65 was arrested over the case in May.
He faced Bathurst Local Court in July, facing 33 separate charges including six counts of sexual intercourse with pupils aged 10 and 18.
Spillane's lawyer, Greg Walsh, says media reports alerted him to the new claims.
I don't know anything about eight alleged other victims, I've not been served with any witness statements so I really can't comment about it, said Walsh.
One former student described the alleged abuse as an orgy, claiming that boys were herded into a prayer room by a priest chanting hypnotic spells in tongues.
It is alleged that boys were subject to sexual abuse or forced to assault each other once in the prayer room.
A former border told The Daily Telegraph that priests got a group between eight and 12 of us together and they'd just start chanting and I would wake up during these sessions and see what was going on.
The allegations came to light after one of the alleged victims made a visit to Bathurst last year to hand out fliers documenting the abuse and providing a link to his website address.
The school called in police, who the victim claims contacted him and asked him to make a complaint.
Two teenagers have been found shot to death in Salford, Greater Manchester, wUK.
One of the victims is a 15-year old girl, the other victim is a male aged 18.
Emergency services were called to reports of a shooting on Saturday morning.
The man died in an ambulance en-route to the hospital.
A Greater Manchester Police spokeswoman said officers were still trying to establish the circumstances of the shooting.
Police were called to Orion Place in Lower Broughton, Salford, following reports that shots had been fired.
Officers attended and discovered the body of a 15-year-old girl.
An 18 year-old boy was also found at the scene.
He was taken to a hospital by ambulance but died a short time later.
The investigation is at a very early stage and inquiries are continuing, the spokeswoman said.
The Heath Avenue area is sealed off while officers investigate.
News articles frequently discuss some issues but neglect others that might be more critical.
Today the UN issued its third annual list to focus attention on a set of these relatively ignored stories.
Police reports state that a bomb blast in a church in Nepal on Saturday has killed two people and injured at least a dozen more.
The attack comes just hours before the national parliament was due to elect a new prime minister.
The bomb detonated in the Church of the Assumption in the town of Lalitpur, located south of Nepal's capital of Kathmandu.
Around 150 people were in the church at the time of the explosion.
According to the Nepalese home ministry spokesman, Navin Ghimire, the National Defence Army, an obscure Hindu extremist group, left a message at the scene of the disaster, assuming responsibility for the explosion.
The group says it wants to return Nepal's Hindu monarchy back to power after it was abolished last year.
It has taken responsibility for the killing of a missionary in July of last year.
This is the first bomb attack on a Christian church in Nepal.
Egypt intends to launch an international initiative to fight misuse of the internet.
The idea lies in implementing a long-term international cooperation plan that concerns suppressing the activity of criminals and other groups that use World Wide Web for promoting their interests.
He also outlined the fact that the plan for fighting cyber-crime stipulates the introduction of new rules for Internet users.
The game does not affect Group D as both Germany and the Czech Republic have already qualified for next summer's tournament.

A new study by Duke University in the US suggests depressed adolescents who respond to treatment within twelve weeks are at a reduced risk of drug abuse later in their lives.
The research followed about half of a pool of 439 adolescents who had received treatment for major depression and volunteered for Duke University research.
At the five-year study's conclusion the participants were aged 17â€“23.
Of those who had experienced a reduction in depressive symptoms within twelve weeks of treatment, ten percent went on to have drug abuse problems.
Alcohol use problems, however, were equally prevalent regardless of treatment outcome.
The study was run by Dr. John Curry, a professor of neuroscience and psychology.
Curry noted that the results for those treated successfully held true whatever they responded to â€” cognitive-behavioral therapy, Prozac, both treatments, or a placebo.
The study has called for treatments to take possible alcohol and drug use into account.
Said Curry, When the teenagers got over the depression, about half of them stayed well for the whole five-year period, but almost half of them had a second episode of depression... what we found out was that, for those who had both alcohol disorder and another depression, the alcohol disorder almost always came first.
He also said the study had a take-home message in that alcohol use disorders are very prevalent during that particular age period and thereâ€™s a need for a lot of prevention and education for college students to avoid getting into heavy drinking and then the beginnings of an alcohol disorder.
Curry, alongside Dr. Susan Silva, a co-author, want more research using larger groups.
They also say work towards a comparison with non-depressed individuals is needed.
The government of Eritrea warned of dire consequences unless Uganda removes its troops from the African Union (AU) peacekeeping force deployed to Somalia.
Ali Abdu, Eritreaâ€™s information minister stated, We believe the government of Uganda must rectify its error and pull out from Somalia, otherwise the situation will become increasingly dangerous.
It will not only worsen, but will become a war between the Somali people and external forces.
Uganda has already sent 1,000 of a planned 1,500 troops under AU auspices to the area.
The AU plans to send 8,000 multinational troops in total, and has recently vowed to continue their deployment despite attacks on its first deployed forces and threats of an Islamist commander.
The Islamic Courts Movement has also threatened to wage jihad against the peacekeeping forces.
Reacting to the comments, Paddy Ankunda, a spokesman for the Uganda Peoples Defense Force (UPDF) said, Eritrea has no right to demand that we withdraw.
Unless they are claiming they are not part of the African Union.
We received a mandate, not only from the AU but also from the UN.
The UPDF forces have been attacked since arriving at Mogadishu on March 6.
They came under mortar fire at the airport during a hand-over ceremony.
Over this week, two UPDF troops were wounded in an ambush and a landmine was discovered on the road leading to the airport.
Two UPDF soldiers were also wounded by shrapnel in the attack and were flown back to Uganda.
Another mortar attack that missed a UPDF convoy and hit a nearby restaurant on March 7 killed 13 civilians and wounded 20.
The UPDF attributed the loss of one of its planes, which burst into flames while landing, to a technical problem and not the result of an insurgent attack.
Eritrea also took the opportunity to condemn its rival Ethiopia that helped install the provisional government of Somalia.
Eritrea claimed that Ethiopia (whom it has a border conflict with) is seeking to carve up the country and was acting as a puppet of the United States.
In the past the United Nations has accused Eritrea of providing arms and equipment to the Islamists.
On October 22, WikiLeaks released nearly 400,000 United States military field reports detailing events of the Iraq War between 2004 and 2009.
That amount of documents makes it the largest leak in the history of the United States military.
The documents report 109,000 deaths during the 2004â€“2009 period, including 66,000 civilians deaths.
The war logs describe scenes of torture and abuse asserted to have been committed by Iraqi security forces.
Safia Ahmed-jan, the director of the Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs for the Khandahar province and an advocate of women's rights and a strong critic of the Taliban's repression of those rights, was shot dead by unidentified gunmen outside her home in Khandahar city in southern Afghanistan on Monday.
A grandfather and his grandson have died off the coast of North Wales, UK, after their sailing dinghy was overwhelmed and capsized in rough seas.
They were with a party of four who had been angling from a 4.6 m boat.
At 4pm local time on Saturday the Holyhead Coastguard received an emergency call from the Star Reader saying they had found a capsized dinghy adrift three and a half miles north of Puffin Island, off the east coast of the Isle of Anglesey.
A third vessel, the Sara Jane, also attended the scene to allow a first aider on board to render assistance.
A RAF search and rescue helicopter was scrambled and the Beaumaris lifeboat launched to effect a rescue effort.
Two people were found clinging to the boat but two more had been washed away.
The rescue helicopter lowered its winchman onto the dinghy to begin CPR on the nine year old boy before he was winched onboard.
He was flown to nearby Bangor Hospital, but later died.
The Beaumaris lifeboat raced the grandfather - also suffering serious hypothermia - ashore to a waiting ambulance, but he too died shortly afterwards.
The lifeboat also carried an uninjured member of the party ashore, while the helicopter returned to rescue a second young boy.
All had been wearing life jackets, but the sea was running at 1.5 m waves in a 45 kmh wind at the time.
It is believed the two dead had been in the water for at least three hours before they were recovered, and died from the effects of hypothermia.
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the president of Brazil, said on Wednesday that not continuing to use biofuels would be a crime against humanity.
Don't tell me, for the love of God, that food is expensive because of biodiesel, said Lula, when talking to reporters.
Lula also stated that he was ready for a debate on biofuels.
I and my government are ready to travel around the world, he said.
This move comes soon after a press release was made available by the European Parliament saying that in the last year scientific evidence, though disputed, has indicated that biofuels may not be as good for the environment as was once thought.
A Washington, D.C. student of Georgetown University has been arrested on suspicion of a hate crime, in which he allegedly beat up another man because the victim was gay.
News reports confirm that the victim - who also goes to the same school - recognized the alleged assailant, because of his profile and photos on Facebook.
Washington DC Metropolitan Police Chief Cathy Lanier announced yesterday that Philip Cooney had been arrested after a warrant was issued for the September 9 attack, which occurred in the 1400 block of 36th Street NW (Between O and P Streets, NW).
The victim was allegedly attacked by a group of males yelling homophobic slurs.
He made it a point to etch the suspect's face in his mind and remember him, Police Lt. Alberto Jova said.
Because of that he was able to give a very positive identification.
The victim in this case suffered a broken thumb and cuts and bruises to his face.
The victim suspected his attacker was also a student at Georgetown, and did extensive examination of information available on Facebook, a popular web site used by students to socialize online.
Cooney could not be reached for comment, and will be arraigned in D.C.
A friend of the alleged assailant was shocked at the allegations and said he is one of the nicest and most gentle people that we know at this school.
The attack is considered unrelated to two other hate crimes which occurred this month in the Northwest quadrant of the city.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh received a successful coronary artery bypass surgery and was recuperating well in the state-run All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Sunday.
Dr. Manmohan Singh is the 17th and current Prime Minister of the Republic of India.
He also serves as the Union Minister for Finance, succeeding P. Chidambaram.
According to critical care specialist Dr. Vijay D'Silva, who has been entrusted with his post-operative care, Singh has been given a liquid diet since morning including a cup of tea, and was speaking to doctors after the procedure.
The way you [doctors] are taking care of me, you should also take care of other people, Dr. D'Silva, who received his basic medical training in Nagpur and headed the ICU at Mumbai's Jaslok and Lilavati Hospitals before he helped set up the ICU at the ultra-modern Asian Heart Institute, quoted Singh as saying.
The second operation always takes longer and makes it difficult to reach the heart.
We did a total of five by-passes to clear multiple blockages in his arteries.
Surgery was the long term answer since there were many blockages.
We will take the PM out of the breathing machine in the next 2-3 hours and the PM should stay for three days in the ICU and then 4-5 days more in the hospital, Drs. Panda and D'Silva explained.
Singh's personal physician and AIIMS cardiac surgeon, Dr. K. S. Reddy, has predicted the PM will be allowed to attend to some official work in two weeks, to most of the duties in four weeks and will be able to resume office in six weeks.
PM was sent to the Operation Theatre at 640 am, surgery was done at 845 am and was concluded at 730 pm.
PM was sent back to the ICU at 855 pm, said Dr. Reddy.
The team has brought about 20 boxes of special equipment with it.
Earlier, Dr. K. S. Reddy had discussions with Dr. Panda in connection with the line of treatment to be followed, the team of 11 doctors said.
The team of surgeons made a 6 to 7 inch incision along the scar that marked the PM's 1990 bypass operation, and he was given five grafts.
The new grafts, all 3 mm long, will last the PM the rest of his life, said Dr. Pradyot Kumar Rath from the Asian Heart Institute.
If the PM could have been so active with all the blockages, he can be even more active now, Dr Panda said.
Singh underwent a coronary angiography at the AIIMS hospital on Tuesday and Wednesday and was discharged on Thursday.
The tests results revealed multiple arterial blockages and Singh returned to hospital on Friday for pre-surgery tests.
External Minister Pranab Kumar Mukherjee, age 73, has been given the charge of Finance Ministry after he held meetings with Congress President Sonia Gandhi and then Prime Minister Singh.
Mukherjee said he would meet the Prime Minister because he was going for treatment and when he was abroad, Singh was in hospital.
You should not be unnecessarily worried over and coming here in large numbers, he said.
Mukherjee has also taken charge over some prime ministerial responsibilities, while Singh recovers, officials and media reports said.
But no acting prime minister has been named while Singh is recuperating.
Mukherjee will also preside over Cabinet meetings and will further handle coal, environment and forests, including information and broadcasting and finance portfolios.
Pranab Kumar Mukherjee, a native of West Bengal, India, is the Minister for External Affairs of India in the Manmohan Singh-led Government of India.
A prominent leader of the Indian National Congress in the 14th Lok Sabha, he is known to be a competent party apparatchik, a prominent Gandhi family loyalist who did not win a popular election until 2004.
Singh, a diabetic, underwent a bypass surgery in Britain in 1990 and had an angioplasty in 2004 in Delhi in which stents were introduced in his arteries.
He had earlier been operated for a benign enlarged prostate in 2007, and for nerve compression in both wrists in 2006 and cataract removal procedure last year, officials said.
The Congress Party, which leads the coalition Government, has said that he will remain Prime Minister if Congress and its allies win again.
But Congress is reportedly planning to replace him, possibly within two years, with Rahul Gandhi, the 38-year-old son of Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born Congress leader.
Days are not far off for Rahul Gandhi to become Indian Prime Minister, Mr Mukherjee said earlier this month.
Rahul is an Indian politician and member of the Parliament of India, representing the Amethi constituency.
He is a member of the Nehru-Gandhi family, the most prominent political family in India.
He is the son of current Italian-born Congress President Sonia Gandhi, and former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who was assassinated in 1991.
Gandhi was 14 years old when his grandmother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, was assassinated by her security guards.
His great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was the first Prime Minister of India, and his great-great-grandfather Motilal Nehru was a distinguished leader of the Indian independence movement.
An Israeli woman was killed early morning today by a Qassam rocket launched by Palestinian fighters from Beit Hanoun in the northern Gaza Strip.
Rockets were launched at the southern Israeli city of Sderoth and several other locations.
Two rockets landed in the city, killing a 57-year-old woman and injuring a 24-year-old bodyguard of the Israeli Defense Minister Amir Peretz, who lives in the city.
The bodyguard lost both legs due to shrapnel wounds and is still in surgery, several hours after the attack.
The Al-Quds Brigades, military wing of Islamic Jihad, took responsibility for the attack, saying they have launched two sophisticated Quds rockets at a mid-range as a retaliation for the IDF artillery shelling of Beit Hanoun earlier this month, in which 19 people were killed.
Izz al-Din al-Qassam, Hamas' military wing, also took responsibility for the attack.
IDF officials said today that the attack was carried out from the area around Beit Hanoun cemetery, where large-scale Qassam launching operation is underway.
Another attack occurred hours later, when another rocket landed near several young men, injuring a 17-year-old youth severely and several others lightly.
With today's attacks, 10 Israelis have been killed by Qassam rockets since 2002 and over 270 injured.
Attacks by Israel aimed at Hamas fighters have killed over 400 Palestinians including many civilians, since June this year.
The UN has certified that the Delhi Metro has aided in the reduction of greenhouse gases, earning 'carbon credits'.
This makes the Delhi Metro the first of its kind in the world to do so.
This comes under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the UN under the Kyoto Protocol.
The UN said the rail based system has helped to save 630,000 tonnes of pollution a year.
The credits to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) are worth $9.5 million for each of the next seven years.
More credits would be given for more passengers on the system.
The credits are designed as a financial incentive for developing countries to reduce greenhouse emissions.
According to the DMRC, it has reduced road traffic by more than 91,000 vehicles per day.
Studies conducted by a team of physicists at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) conclude that new synthetic NBA basketballs are less lively, more slippery when damp, and bounce more erratically than the traditional leather balls.
James Horwitz, Chairman of the UTA Department of Physics was contacted by the Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban to study the new ball.
Horwitz asked UTA physics professor Kaushik De to lead the project.
De's team found that the new balls are tackier when dry, but become much more slippery than leather balls when they get damp.
Traditional leather basketballs provide more grip when they are slightly wet.
The synthetic balls bounce 30% more sporadically, possibly due to deep embossing, and are less lively than leather basketballs.
Some of these issues could be fixed with a variety of methods, including modification of the embossing, increasing the air pressure in the balls beyond the regulation 8.5 psi, and constantly drying the balls with towels during the game or frequently replacing them with fresh basketballs, say De and Horwitz.
Erosion in Nigeria has lead to increasing concern on climate policy for the entire country.
Areas in Nigeria have been subject to damages caused by increasing erosion for over 50 years.
This issue has grown over the past years, and responsibility has been pointed at a lack of national policy.
However, locals recognize that they too contribute to the problem.
Some of the problem of erosion is created by our people, by our attitude to waste disposal.
When we dump garbage in the drains that are built by the government we simply aggravate the problem of erosion, said state environmental commissioner Michael Egbebike.
And this waste combined with the force of the flood and trying to erode the soil and sometimes they actually block the channel that has been created for flood dispersion and the floods come back and actually destroy their homes, and at that point they call on government, he added.
Geological studies of the area affected most by erosion, Anambra, have concluded that the cost of implementing a project which could effectively slow erosion are estimated at US$2 billion.
Officials are looking for answers and help in funding a project at the Copenhagen environmental conference in December.
The state is struggling because the monies spent on this erosion problem are huge sums of money.
So we will of course need a lot of help from the international community and the federal government.
Alone it would be a Herculean task for Anambra state, commented Egbebike.
A Polish soldier was killed yesterday by a roadside bomb in eastern Afghanistan.
Kazimierz Kasprzak was killed in the province of Ghazni when a roadside bomb exploded underneath the patrol vehicle in which he was travelling.
His death was announced by the Polish Defence Ministry and Lt. Sebastian Kostecki, a spokesman for the Polish military.
Kasprzak was airlifted to a military base after the explosion but died during surgery.
With his death the toll of Polish forces killed in Afghanistan has risen to 21.
Polish forces joined NATO in their fight with the Taliban in March 2002.
President of Poland Bronislaw Komorowski has said he has planned to pull Polish troops out of Afghanistan by 2012.
Many Polish citizens favor pulling troops out of the war zone.
On Thursday, May 26, Amnesty International urged foreign governments to investigate high-level U.S. government officials for human rights violations committed in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
William Schulz, the executive director of the U.S. branch of Amnesty International, said that governments have an obligation under international law to conduct investigations into alleged human rights violations.
Amnesty International released a list, which Schulz read in his speech Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, former CIA Director George Tenet, Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, Maj. Gen. Geoffrey Miller, former commander of US forces in Iraq and current commander of the Joint Task Force Guantanamo, and Douglas Feith, the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.
In 1998, General Pinochet of Chile was arrested in London after a Spanish judge issued an international arrest warrant.
Schulz claims that similar measures could apply to members of the current U.S. administration such as Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld or Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan has described recent criticisms of the United States regarding alleged human rights abuses as unsupported by the facts.
President Bush, in a press conference on Tuesday, was asked about Amnesty International's report.
In terms of the detainees, we've had thousands of people detained.
It seemed like to me they based some of their decisions on the word of â€” and the allegations â€” by people who were held in detention, people who hate America, people that had been trained in some instances to disassemble â€” that means not tell the truth.
A zoo worker is dead and two visitors are seriously injured after a Siberian tiger escaped from the San Francisco Zoo in San Francisco, California in the United States and attacked three people who were inside a cafe.
The tiger was shot dead by police who were called to the scene.
They found the tiger attacking one of the zoo visitors when they killed it.
Apparently, right around closing time -- there was a pen with four tigers in it -- one of the tigers got out.
The tiger went into a cafe at the zoo and attacked a patron.
They shot the tiger, and the tiger is deceased, said zoo spokeswoman Mindy Talmadge.
After the tiger attacked the worker, it then went on to attack the two other visitors.
No names have been released, but reports say that the two injured visitors are male and brothers aged 18 and 19.
The person killed is also being reported as male aged 23 who is reportedly a friend of the brothers.
Both the injured individuals are currently receiving treatment at San Francisco General Hospital.
All animals were then counted and accounted for after the zoo was locked down, including the three other tigers that were in the cage.
Earlier reports suggested that all of the tigers had escaped, which later turned out to be false.
The incident is currently under investigation, but authorities are not ruling out any possibilities, including possible negligence.
We won't know until tomorrow whether this was negligence or intentional or how the tiger got out, said Sgt.
The zoo has two different kinds of tigers, two Siberian and one Sumatran tigers.
The Siberian tigers are named Tony and Tatiana while the Sumatran is named Padang.
It is not yet known which of the two Siberian tigers was involved in the attacks.
Last year, another zoo worker was seriously injured by Tatiana while attempting to feed her, but survived the attack.
The powerful storm system that flooded parts of the Midwest and the Plains moved through Ohio today.
Six people were killed in Oklahoma, eight were killed in Texas, and one person was killed in Missouri due to the storms.
The flooding was a result of a powerful storm system combined with the remnants of Tropical Storm Erin.
Some parts of the U.S. saw eleven inches of rain in the matter of a few hours on Monday.
The storms moved into Ohio on Tuesday, flooding a seven-mile (11 km) stretch of Interstate 75 in northwestern Ohio.
Sheriff's Lt. Neil Riedlinger said, water was over 3 feet (1 m) deep in some areas of downtown Carey, Ohio, and a local nursing home had to be evacuated.
And, about 200 people were evacuated in the Akron, Ohio area due to severe flooding.
Southwestern Wisconsin was under another flash flood watch Tuesday night and Wednesday, with a chance of rain through Friday.
On Monday, the heavy rain flooded street, streams, and a sewage treatment plant in Iowa.
Wind gusts of up to 82 mph (132 kmh) and golf-ball sized hail were reported in Nebraska from these storms.
In Minnesota, a dive team and a National Guard helicopter were called in to search for Jered Lorenz, 37, whose car was found overturned lodged in between rocks along a creek.
Numerous mud slides were reported all across Minnesota, an area believed to be among the hardest hit areas according to meteorologists.
Ben Tracy of WCCO-TV in Rushford, Minnesota reported, It's the worst flooding anyone here has seen in 30 years.
Orange X's in the area mark buildings that have already been searched for survivors.
The United States Marshals Service working together with nearly 960 other law enforcement agencies recently concluded a week-long operation, Operation FALCON, which succeeded in the arrest of 10,340 fugitives across the United States and elsewhere.
Other regional sweeps have been conducted before; but this was the first of its kind at the national level and resulted in the highest number of arrests ever recorded in a single operation.
Operation FALCON, which stands for Federal And Local Cops Organized Nationally, received the cooperation of more than 3,000 law enforcement agents from the US Marshals, state, county and city level, and other US agencies.
Operations were also coordinated internationally with INTERPOL and the US State Department, resulting in the detainment of 16 foreign and international fugitives.
Operation FALCON was conducted during a one week period, April 4-10, 2005, chosen to coincide with National Crime Victim's Rights Week, April 10-16, the dates being chosen to honor the victims of violent crime in America.
â€œBy taking violent fugitives off the streets and putting them behind bars where they belong,â€ said Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, â€œwe've honored the victims and made our streets safer.â€
The focus of Operation FALCON was on apprehending fugitives wanted for violent crimes, gang activities, drug trafficking, and sex-related offenses.
Arrests were made in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and in several International locales.
â€œI applaud the achievements of every Deputy Marshal, police officer, detective, trooper, investigator, deputy sheriff, and special agent who hit the street virtually around-the-clock for seven days,â€ said Robert J. Finan II, the Marshals Serviceâ€™s Assistant Director for Investigative Services.
He continued, â€œAlso of note is that during the course of this initiative, there were no serious incidents or serious injuries to either law enforcement officers or those who were taken into custody.â€
Benjamin Mullany, the British man who was shot along with his wife while on holiday in Antigua has died.
He and his wife, Catherine had been on the last day of their honeymoon when both were shot during what seems to be a botched robbery on July 29.
Doctors were unaware if he knew that his wife did not survive the attack.
Ben was flown back to Britain on August 2 after a 22 hour operation to try and save his life.
He died at Morriston Hospital, in Swansea, Wales where he remained unresponsive.
The couple married on July 12 and later flew out to the holiday island.
With the death of both Catherine and Ben the murder figures for Antigua have been placed into double figures.
Prime minister Baldwin Spencer has asked for Britain's help during the investigation.
The Supreme Leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-il, has died according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).
The cause of death was advanced acute myocardial infarction, complicated by serious heart shock, commonly known as a heart attack.
Kim apparently died two days earlier on December 17 aboard a train.
However, other records from the former Soviet Union place his age at 70.
At the same time, Kim's son, Kim Jong-un has been named as the Great Successor by North Korean state media.
Citizens are being told they must faithfully revere respectable comrade Kim Jong-un.
At the leadership of comrade Kim Jong-un, we have to change sadness to strength and courage and overcome today's difficulties, according to KCNA.
According to Yonhap News Agency, South Korea's military is on emergency alert following a meeting by South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS).
According to a JCS official, We're keeping close tabs on the demilitarized zone (DMZ), Joint Security Area (JSA) and Northern Limit Line (NLL) for possibilities of North Korean provocations.
South Korean President Lee Myung-bak also presided over a meeting.
A statement from Lee's office said, The government will remain thoroughly prepared while keeping a close watch over the situation in North Korea.
The government will also cooperate closely with the international community to maintain peace and safety on the Korean Peninsula.
A critical campaign ad, launched by the US Republican Party, that took a swipe at Canada has been pulled.
Canada can take care of North Korea, a man in the television ad says.
The ad's purpose was to blast Democratic Senate candidate Harold Ford Jr, who is running against Republican Bob Corker.
The comment about Canada is secondary to the ad's first purpose.
An official for the Republican National Committee told NBC the ad had been pulled because it had run its course, just one day after party chairman Ken Mehlman defended the ad and said it would continue to run.
Just imagine if I registered a complaint every time my country or president was criticized, said the U.S. Ambassador to Canada, David Wilkins.
Compare that (one ad) with the criticism early this year during the (federal) election that happened every day in Canada ...ads that were run consistently throughout your country.
A source within the Canadian government told the Canadian Press that Canadian ambassador to the U.S. Michael Wilson called the White House to remind the Republicans of the heavy load Canada is carrying in Afghanistan.
The Canadian Embassy in Washington has been on an advertising campaign, plastering subway stations in Washington with posters depicting Canadian troops in Afghanistan.
There is also a website featuring military cooperation between Canada and the U.S.
The Canadian ambassador to the U.S. has issued a complaint to Washington in response to the television ad.
The 30 second ad (see source below) can now be viewed on YouTube.
A wet late Spring season's increase in rainfall helped duck populations rebound in the northern Great Plains near the U.S.-Canadian border.
A dry Winter and resulting low ground water levels threatened duck nesting grounds in the area.
Much to the relief of duck hunters, who feared a possible 2005 ban on duck hunting, the most-recent waterfowl survey released this week by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service showed duck populations in South Dakota on the rebound.
This contrasted to a May survey that showed fewer ducks and waterfowl nesting areas in the state with the population of breeding ducks numbering 1.6 million, down from 1.7 million in 2004.
The same May survey indicated that duck habitats, specifically ponds, had declined more than 35 percent from the historical average.
However, late Spring rains reportedly improved wetland conditions and irrigated grasslands for grazing duck broods and re-nesting hens.
The figures are used to set duck-hunting limits for the fall season, which begins in August.
I have observed many duck broods across eastern South Dakota in July, and grassland cover looks great statewide, Spencer Vaa, a waterfowl biologist with the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks said in an Associated Press report.
Germany's minister of defence, Franz-Josef Jung (CDU), has proposed to shoot down planes hijacked by terrorists.
Although the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany decided in February 2006 that shooting down a hijacked plane would only be lawful if there were no innocent passengers on the plane, Jung announced in public that he would give the order to attack if the basic principles of the constitution were in danger or if the plane posed a tremendous threat to the people.
Representatives of the grand coalition differed in their views regarding this question.
A member of the Social Democrat Party disagreed with Jung and advised him against contradicting the court's judgment.
The opposition in parliament even called Jung an enemy of the constitution and called for him to resign.
Jung was supported by members of his own party which underlined the necessity of shooting down a hijacked plane in order to save thousands of lives.
The dispute between the two coalition partners concerning new laws to ensure the security of Germany remains unresolved.
The pilots of the German airforce have made it clear that they won't bring down a hijacked plane due to fundamental legal and moral doubts.
In the United States and other European countries such as France, Great Britain or the Czech Republic laws were passed which give the government permission to shoot down a passenger plane under the control of terrorists.
Britain has stated that it will reconsider the asylum application of a gay Iranian teenager who believes he will be persecuted for his sexuality if he is deported back to Iran.
The announcement Friday by the British government came after the European Parliament urged a resolution to the case and said that Iran has a history of torturing and executing homosexuals.
Britain had initially rejected an asylum request by 19-year-old Mehdi Kazemi, and Kazemi fled to the Netherlands, where his case was turned down and he returned to Britain.
British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith released a statement on the case Following representations made on behalf of Mehdi Kazemi, and in the light of new circumstances since the original decision was made, I have decided that Mr. Kazemi's case should be reconsidered on his return to the UK from the Netherlands.
Eighty members of Britain's upper house of Parliament sent a letter to Jacqui Smith, appealing to the government to show compassion and allow Mr. Kazemi to have a safe haven in the United Kingdom.
Roger Roberts of the House of Lords initiated the petition, and stated There is no doubt that he will be persecuted and possibly face state-sanctioned murder if he is forced to return.
Simon Hughes, Member of Parliament for North Southwark and Bermondsey, said he would support Kazemi if he returns to the United Kingdom I hope Mr Kazemi will now come back to Britain where arrangements are already in place for an urgent meeting with him, his family, specialist lawyers and myself to prepare a new application to the Home Office.
Gay rights advocate and spokesman for the British gay rights group OutRage!, David Allison commented It's cruel to even suggest sending him back â€¦
Ben Summerskill of the British gay rights organization, Stonewall, said We are obviously delighted that the home secretary has listened to the representations that were made in this case â€¦
There are overwhelming reasons why people should not be deported to Iran in the current circumstances, and it is important that Britain is seen as a safe haven.
His uncle spoke with CNN on condition of anonymity, and said that his nephew was studying in Britain in 2006 when his partner in Iran was arrested and hanged after being charged with sodomy.
Kazemi's uncle told CNN Under torture and pressure, (the partner) revealed Mehdi's name as his boyfriend.
Gay sex is considered a crime in Iran, and is punishable by death.
After Britain's Home Office initially denied Kazemi's asylum application, he fled to Canada and then the Netherlands, where he was detained.
Kazemi faces deportation from the Netherlands to Britain, after their highest court rejected his plea on Tuesday.
The Netherlands' highest court rejected the case, citing EU law that Kazemi's case was the responsibility of the country where he first requested asylum.
A resolution passed by the European Parliament Thursday asked EU states to find a common solution to ensure that Mehdi Kazemi is granted asylum or protection on EU soil and not sent back to Iran.
The resolution also stated that Iranian authorities routinely detain, torture and execute persons, notably homosexuals and that Mehdi's partner has already been executed, while his father has threatened him with death.
In a September 2007 speech at Columbia University, Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was challenged by University president Lee Bollinger for Iran's treatment of gays.
Ahmadinejad stated that In Iran we don't have homosexuals like in your country, drawing laughter from the audience.
In Iran we do not have this phenomenon, I don't know who has told you that we have it.
According to Iranian human rights activists, over 4,000 gay men and lesbians have been executed since the Iranian Revolution of 1979.
Belgian authorities have confirmed that at least eighteen people died in a head-on collision between two passenger trains in the suburbs of Brussels.
Other reports suggest that the death toll could be as high as 25.
More than 125 passengers are reported injured, 11 of them very seriously.
Rescuers were still trying to free bodies from the wreckage of the trains more than eight hours after the crash, which occurred in snowy conditions at 0828 local time (0728 UTC) near the station of Buizingen in the municipality of Halle, about 15 kilometres southwest of the Belgian capital.
The collision saw the first two carriages of one train being forced upwards into the air over the first carriage of the second train.
Eyewitnesses described the collision as brutal, with passengers being thrown violently around the carriages.
Television footage showed the two smashed locomotives forced up in the air, with passenger cars strewn over a wide area and dazed survivors wandering at the crash site.
Train speed at the time of the crash was not immediately known.
There are reports that one of the trains ran a stop signal.
Initial reports suggest that the Leuvenâ€“Braine-le-Comte train was on the wrong line.
It is not known if the train went through a red signal or if there was a problem with the signalling.
A well informed source quoted by French-language daily Le Soir suggested that there might have been an electrical failure in the signalling system.
The collision occurred on one of the main access lines to Brussels-South station, about 14 kilometres (9 miles) from the Belgian capital.
It caused major damage to overhead power cables, especially on the Brusselsâ€“Mons and Brusselsâ€“Tournai lines, and high speed rail services between Brussels and France and the UK have been suspended.
Thalys services were temporarily halted due to the accident, with four of its trains in the region being diverted to alternative stations.
Thalys services between Brussels and Cologne have now resumed, but services to Amsterdam and Paris are still suspended.
One passenger on board, Christian Wampach, described conditions on board the train, It was a nightmare.
There were a number of people injured in my car but I think all the dead were in the first car.
Another passenger, Patricia Lallemand, said, When we came out we saw dead bodies lying next to the tracks, some mutilated.
The famous Greek lawyers, Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos have been imprisoned in the Athens' jail of Korydallus, as they were found guilty of graft and corruption.
As a result of this, a big scandal within the Greek legal community has been raised through the exposure of illegal actions that judges, lawyers, solicitors and attorneys have done during the previous years.
A few weeks ago, after the information published by the journalist Makis Triantafylopoulos in his popular Television show Zoungla in Alpha TV, the member of Parliament and lawyer, Petros Mantouvalos was abdicated as members of his office had been involved in illegal graft and corruption.
Moreover, top judge Evangelos Kalousis is imprisoned as he found guilty of corruption and degenerate behaviour.
Except from journalists' research about scandals in the legal Community of Greece, accusations from well-known lawyers and attorneys such as the famous Athens' lawyer Alexis Kougias, against colleagues have as a result a greater dialogue and discussion in the country upon this important issue.
A decades-old building collapsed along Ma Tau Wai Road in Hong Kong at about 130pm on Friday, local time.
That building was located at 45J, Ma Tau Wai Road in Hung Hom.
A shop on its ground floor was undergoing renovations when the building collapsed.
Firefighters arrived at the scene to search survivors and they asked residents in the buildings nearby to evacuate the area.
Chief Executive Donald Tsang called for an investigation into the cause of the building collapse.
The government required all old buildings with similar structures to undergo inspection, according to Secretary for Development Carrie Lam.
The government has confirmed that four people were dead in the incident.
Rescue efforts ended on Saturday morning when the government confirmed that no one was missing.
Lam visited the scene on Saturday afternoon and sought advice from the police and Buildings Department.
Secretary for Labour & Welfare Matthew Cheung said that the government would do its best to meet the victims' needs.
The government had inspected its five-storey structure before the incident and had ordered repairs.
After the tragedy, the government announced that it would inspect buildings older than 50 years in one month.
The government has restricted access to buildings at 45G and 45H as they were in danger.
Thoroughbred horse racing has been cancelled indefinitely in the Australian states of New South Wales and Queensland due to an outbreak of Equine Influenza.
An Australia-wide ban on the movement of horses, donkeys and mules which was due to expire on Wednesday has been extended until Friday.
So far the virus only appears to have infected horses in NSW and Queensland, with 51 confirmed cases and another 400 suspected.
So far all those infected appear to be horses used for recreational purposes and not thoroughbred race horses.
Despite the bans on racing and horse movements, track work will recommence in NSW and Queensland today.
It had been feared yesterday that four race horses at Randwick Racecourse in Sydney had been struck down by the virus, but the horses later tested negative to the virus.
If an outbreak were to occur at Randwick it could affect up to 700 race horses stabled there.
The outbreak comes at a bad time for the industry, as it prepares for the lucrative spring racing season in Sydney and Melbourne.
The AUD$1 million Golden Rose event at Rosehill has been cancelled, although it is expected that Melbourne's spring racing carnival will resume on Saturday as no cases of the flu have been seen in Victoria.
Racing Victoria has also said the Melbourne Cup will go ahead as planned despite the outbreak, even if no interstate or international horses can attend.
Despite fines of up to $44,000 and 12 months imprisonment in NSW there have been reports that more than 100 horse owners have been caught moving their horses.
The NSW Primary Industries Minister Ian Macdonald, said it was absolutely vital that no-one moves a horse in this state.
We will be working with police to ensure horses are at a standstill, he said.
The racing bans have cost gaming companies Tabcorp and Tattersall's millions, with Tabcorp losing $65 million in revenue on the weekend.
Tabcorp expects to lose around $150 million in turnover this week.
Tattersall's has also said it expects to lose around $2 million in revenue per week due to the outbreak.
Investors reacted to the news, slashing 3 percent of the price of Tattersall's shares and over 4 percent of those of Tabcorp.
Relatively unknown Indiana Senator Evan Bayh is taking steps to make a run for U.S. President during the 2008 election cycle.
Bayh has formed a political action committee (PAC) and already is a leading money-raiser among Democratic party hopefuls.
The Hoosier politician also is touting his appeal to traditionally republican voters.
Australia's coastwatch has found a missing boat which with more than 40 passengers after it had left Indonesia's Papua province, reportedly bound for Australia.
Initial reports say the vessel has been spotted off Cape York, three days after it was reported missing.
The Australia West Papua Association (AWPA) says the boat was carrying people who left for security reasons as a campaign against Indonesian rule of the Melanesian province continues.
Any application for possible asylum can only be submitted to the Australian authorities if they reach the Australian mainland.
Australia operates a detention centre in Nauru to process people intercepted at sea while trying to reach Australia illegally.
The AWPA said the group had been forced to flee Papua by boat because the usual way of leaving the province â€” by crossing the eastern border into Papua New Guinea â€” had been made more difficult by increased surveillance.
No one (has) come from West Papua in boats before like this, seeking political asylum, said a spokesperson for AWPA.
Fears for the safety of the asylum-seekers mounted over the weekend after the group failed to turn up on Australia's Cape York Peninsula after leaving Papua's Merauke port on Friday morning.
The group had reportedly been making the 250 kilometre journey across the Torres Strait in a 25-metre traditional boat.
A vessel fitting the information reported was located by Coastwatch at about 2pm at Cape York, an immigration department spokeswoman told AFP.
Customs and government officials were on their way to meet the boat, she added.
The plane reportedly skidded off the wet runway, crossed a busy thoroughfare before careening into a fuel depot and warehouse ultimately bursting into flames.
The plane accelerated when it reached the end of the runway and tried to take off again to avoid the road, but it crashed into the building and exploded, Junior Matos told AFP.
Authorities believe that all 180 people onboard the plane have died, and a further 15 people on the ground are feared dead as well.
Low clouds and heavy rain were reported at the time of the crash.
Additionally, the runway has had a history of problems with standing water.
Neither of these factors have been linked to the cause of the crash at this point.
Rodrigo Pinho, state attorney, said the authorities will thoroughly investigate to determine the cause and to identify who was responsible.
With the announcement Monday of â‚¬2 million in new funding from the European Union (EU), the Republic of Djibouti's Ministry of Agriculture hopes to provide some relief to an estimated 25,000 rural inhabitants suffering through severe drought conditions.
The money, to be channeled through UNICEF for its water and sanitation program, will be used to develop new wells and improve existing ones.
UNICEF is to contribute a further â‚¬60,000, as well as technical expertise to the Ministry of Agriculture, who will carry out the bulk of the work.
At the same time, the UN aid agency World Food Program (WFP) indicated that it is working with the Ministry of Agriculture and UNICEF to gradually shift Djibouti's reliance on emergency aid to a Food for Work program, which it hopes will assist nomadic herders in Djibouti with long-term sustainability.
What we are trying to do together with the Ministry of Agriculture and UNICEF is, for example to dig wells so that despite drought, these herders will be able to irrigate their fields, said Simon Pluess, WFP spokesman.
And, together with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, we will try and promote vegetable gardens.
Djibouti has survived harsh drought conditions for the past 5 years.
Groundwater is the primary source of water for drinking and irrigation, but has been difficult to exploit and is often contaminated.
Almost 50 percent of people in rural Djibouti do not have ready access to properly developed source of drinking water.
And, due to the ongoing drought, water availability for livestock is limited.
Livestock have shown signs of distress and, subsequently, milk production is down substantially.
Nearly half of all families in Djibouti's northwest were forced to migrate to find pasture for their livestock.
As the droughts continue, the importance of properly maintained wells has become apparent.
Years ago there were more rains and also more pastureland for cattle.
Now it is good for us to have functioning wells so that we can keep cattle here, said Anou Amada, farmer in the village of Andoli.
A 2006 survey indicated that only 15 percent of wells in Djibouti were equipped with a protective concrete wall to prevent contamination.
Andoli's well is one of many undergoing repair through WFP's Food for Work project.
â€œWFP couldnâ€™t do this alone, so we work with the Ministry of Agriculture and UNICEF to dig wells and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization for vegetable gardens,â€ said Benoit Thiry, Director, WFP in Djibouti.
When the project is completed in 2008, it will have increased Djibouti's water pump capacity by adding 25 solar-power pumps, which would compliment the current 61 diesel-powered pumps.
The advantage of solar...is that it is much cheaper and requires less maintenance, said Omar Habib, UNICEF communication specialist.
We want the people to participate and to appropriate these pumping stations.
The governmentâ€™s role in the long term should be as restricted as possible, he added.
NASA launched the Lunar Precursor Robotic Program space probes, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) on board the Atlas V rocket at 532 p.m. EDT (2132 GMT) from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.
Due to nearby thunderstorms the launch was delayed about 20 minutes from the scheduled launch time of 5.12 p.m. EDT (2112 GMT).
The mission will be NASA's first unmanned rocket expedition to the moon in a decade.
The aim of the LRO mission is to spend at least a year in a low polar orbit above the surface of the moon to gather neccesary data for future missions and longer lunar expeditions.
It will be orbiting approximately 30 miles (48 km) above the moon, trying to find safe landing sites, locating potential resources, characterizing the radiation environment and testing new technology.
The 2,300 pounds (1,043 kg) spent upper stage Centaur motor of the Atlas V launch vehicle will strike the surface of the moon at 9,000 kmh (5,600 mph) resulting in a 350 ton (317 metric ton) plume of debris rising between 6 to 30 miles (10 to 48 km) above the moon's surface.
From this impact, scientists hope to be able to detect any water ice or vapor using the LCROSS satellite which will crash land nearby four minutes later.
Astronomers who own amateur-class telescopes with apertures as small as 10 to 12 inches may be able to sight the ejecta cloud as it will have a period of brightness about one minute after impact.
The launch was originally planned for yesterday, but delayed for the launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavour, which was itself later delayed again due to another hydrogen fuel leak.
Around twelve people were killed in Iraq today while they were playing football on a makeshift pitch in a predominantly Shi'a area in west Baghdad.
According to police, two bombs, which had been planted in the middle of the pitch, were detonated.
Earlier today, Iraqâ€™s President revealed Iraqi troops would take over safekeeping of the entire country from American troops by the end of 2006.
He said the takeover would occur gradually but would be complete by the start of 2007.
Yesterday, more than fifty people were killed across the country.
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia has been admitted to a hospital in Riyadh for testing.
Unofficial sources say that the King, who has been ill since 1995, might have water in his lungs, possibly indicating pneumonia.
Crown Prince Abdullah has performed most of the duties of the aging monarch in recent years, and is a very likely candidate for succession of the throne should King Fahd succumb to his illness.
This week saw the English-language version of Wikipedia, the collaboratively written online encyclopedia, reach 2,000 featured articles with the inclusion of the article El SeÃ±or Presidente.
Featured articles (FAs) meet Wikipedia's highest standards for quality, accuracy, neutrality, completeness, and style, and thus are considered the best articles on Wikipedia.
The Wikipedia team that carries out the assessment and quality control before conferring the status of featured articles promoted five articles to FA status at the same time Walter de Coventre, Maximian, El SeÃ±or Presidente, Lord of the Universe, and Red-billed Chough.
With five promoted at the same time, conferring the status of 2,000th on one is an arbitrary decision and in some respects any of these articles could actually make a claim to the honour.
The professor of the class, Jon Beasley-Murray, began using Wikipedia as a collaborative space where his students could both do coursework and provide a type of virtual public service.
Thus, he created a Wikipedia project, Murder Madness and Mayhem, that focussed on creating articles relating to the Latin American literature covered in his class.
The Wikinews team contacted Prof. Beasley-Murray, who agreed to be interviewed for this story.
Thus far the project has created seven good articles in addition to the 2,000th featured article.
After he had repeated this publicly, he was arrested and charged with apostasy.
Iranian authorities later claimed he was jailed for spying for Israel, but this was contradicted by the court documents.
They say they hold the Iranian authorities responsible for his death and his only crime was belief in his religion.
The United States Border Patrol has announced that a Border agent, Brian Terry aged 40, was shot and killed in Southern Arizona near the border with Mexico on Tuesday night after a shoot out with suspected bandits who were targeting illegal immigrants.
Reports state that at least four suspects are in custody with one suspect still at large.
Terry was killed at around 1100 p.m. local time (PST) Tuesday night near Rio Rico.
Border Patrol spokesman Eric Cantu told the Associated Press that the FBI is probing the agent's death and had few details at the time.
Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Protection also released a statement saying, Our thoughts and prayers are with the Terry family for their tragic loss.
Our commitment to Agent Terry and his family is that we will do everything possible to bring to justice those responsible for this despicable act.
U.S. flags across Arizona will be flown at half-staff in honor of Terry.
Local government officials have said that at least eleven people were killed on Sunday in southern Afghanistan by a roadside bomb.
The governor's spokesman, Daud Ahmadi, said to media that a civilian car struck a roadside bomb in Nawzad district.
According to the spokesman, a family was riding on a tractor with a truck-bed hitched on back, when it hit the explosives on a central road; all of the people aboard died, including two children and two women.
The incident comes several weeks after soldiers from the US, NATO, and Afghanistan, initiated an offensive against the Taleban in Helmand's Marjah and Nad Ali areas on February 13.
On the same day that the Yad Vashem Holocaust History Museum was opened this year, a lesser-known museum and educational center was opened by a Muslim man in the Israeli town of Nazareth.
This unique museum, intended to raise awareness of past Jewish suffering in the eyes of Palestinians through historical photographs and Arabic-language educational materials, is believed to be the first-ever Arab holocaust museum.
Nazareth is of course well-known to Christians as the site where Joseph and Mary brought up the child Jesus.
In modern times, Nazareth is the largest Arab town in Israel, having many self-proclaimed Palestinians, a Muslim majority, and a 35% Arab-Christian minority.
The museum's owner Khaleed Mahameed, a 43-year old lawyer, husband, and father of two, said that he learned about the holocaust during his time at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
He spent about 20,000 shekels (US$4,500) of his own money in order to create the museum, despite the alienation of his own brother, the rejection of the Arab news media, and a public that is slow to accept his ideas.
Mahameed purchased about 80 photographs from the more well-known museum at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, site of Israel's national memorial to the Shoah (holocaust), located on the Har Hazikaron (Mount of Remembrance).
The newly enlarged Israeli museum at Yad Vashem, opened March 15 with the attendance of President Moshe Katsav, replaced what was the world's first holocaust museum, established in 1972.
As part of his effort to educate Palestinians, Mahameed has printed 2,000 booklets in Arabic describing photographs of Nazi horrors, offered stipends to Arab students of the subject, and started a new museum website (Alkaritha.org) with some translations offered in English, Arabic, and Hebrew.
Mahameed believes contributions such as his are necessary to the Mideast peace effort.
Understanding this and the fact that personal security is perhaps the major concern of Jews in Israel and elsewhere, as a direct outcome of the Holocaust and the feelings of persecution, is extremely important.
If we, as Arabs, can dissipate these concerns and show understanding over what happened it will help create the climate for real dialogue in which Israeli Jews and especially decision-makers will be able to have a greater understanding of the suffering of Arab citizens and the Palestinians.
This, in turn, would hopefully lead towards a peaceful resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and an end to discriminatory policies towards Arab citizens and the acceptance that they deserve equal rights.
Mahameed is not without his critics, not only among Arabs who say that Mahameed should do more to draw attention to the situation of present-day Palestinians, but also representatives of the Israel office of the Jewish Anti-Defamation League (ADL), who have stated without visiting the museum that they consider some of the attitudes expressed on Mahameed's website to be anti-Semitic.
The establishment of the first Holocaust museum for the Arabic-speaking public can be an important first step in educating the Arab world on the unique horrors of the destruction of European Jewry.
Particularly now, at a time when Holocaust denial is rife both within and outside of the Arab world, the attempt to teach young Arabs about the Holocaust and to learn moral and ethical lessons from it is a worthy pursuit.
If however, the Arab Institute for Holocaust Research and Education is, as noted on its Web site, ideologically grounded in the belief that it was the Palestinian people who paid the price for European guilt over the Holocaust by imposing what they believe is an illegitimate Jewish state in the heart of the Arab world then the institute will merely propagate the classic anti-Israel use of the Holocaust and promote anti-Semitism.
Friday was Yom Hashoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day in Israel, a day of solemn reflection on the loss of 5 to 7 million Jewish lives due to unprovoked Nazi aggression in World War II.
Images, films and documentaries of the Holocaust are typically broadcast throughout the Israeli news media on that day, deeply affecting the survivors and their children.
However, these images do not typically reach a Palestinian audience, according to museum visitor Mufeed Khattib last month.
Perhaps I didn't see it well because it was on Israeli TV, he said.
It is different for me that an Arab man did this.
On CNN's Anderson Cooper-hosted 360 Degrees program, former British Prime Minister John Major said, I think it's now patently apparent that there are people in the United Kingdom (who) are alienated from the Anglo-Saxon way of life and are prepared to indulge in these dreadful acts of criminality.
Ekow Eshun of the Newstatesman writes that Major's comments belong on the dustheap of history along with cricket.
The former British leader has also been recently quoted as saying in reference to the Brazilian citizen killed by police; I rather prefer the expression shoot to protect rather than shoot to kill â€” I think that is a more accurate description of what happened.
In addition Sir John has come out as an advocate of deportation for people who express distaste for the Anglo-Saxon way of life.
The Saudi ambassador to London, Prince Turki al-Faisal, is voicing the same position as Major regarding the need for deporting some of the Muslim clerics.
In the 1960s there was born a somewhat similar America, love it or leave it viewpoint among American conservatives, a viewpoint that is still the subject of debate today.
Villagers near the town of Goroka in the jungle-covered highlands about 400 kilometres north of the capital Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea killed four women they believed to be witches.
They tortured the women by stabbing them with hot rods so they would confess to causing a road crash using sorcery.
The accident had resulted in the death of three prison guards.
With the help of some village elders, police have now discovered these murders which occurred in October of last year.
BBC News reports human rights campaigners saying that it is not uncommon in Papua New Guinea for women suspected of engaging in black magic to be killed, often by hanging or burning.
New Zealand's national airline, Air New Zealand has announced that they will be flying direct to Canada.
Flights from Auckland to Vancouver will operate three times a week between November and March, to coincide with the peak travel season between the two destinations, as Canadians escape winter and New Zealand skiers head to the Canadian slopes.
46,000 Canadians visit New Zealand and 16,000 New Zealanders visit Canada each year, starting at the end of this year.
The reinstatement of the Vancouver link restores a route phased out in the 1990s.
Canadian visitors make up two percent of international visitor arrivals, however they stay longer and spend more in New Zealand than many other visitors spent an average of 29 days in New Zealand in 2006, and spent almost $3400 each.
In total, they contributed $136 million to New Zealand's economy.
Tourism New Zealand chief executive, George Hickton has said that the direct flights will make New Zealand look much more appealing to the Canadian market.
The Tourism Industry Association New Zealand say that the new route has the added benefit of freeing up seats on Air New Zealand's busy routes from San Francisco and Los Angeles.
This unusual hurricane season, one of the most active in history, has produced another strange storm.
Category 1 Hurricane Vince, which was formed from a non-tropical low today, is forecast to head east towards Portugal, rather than west as is usual.
Vince caught forecasters by surprise, since the waters in the area are around 25ÂºC.
Few expected Vince to even form in the cool waters, much less to become a hurricane.
Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center do not expect Vince to be a hurricane for long.
It is forecast to weaken as it moves towards Portugal, and to finally become extratropical.
In about 48 hours, they believe Vince will be absorbed by a front in Portugal or Spain.
A rescue operation is underway after sixteen-year-old American Abby Sunderland, attempting to sail around the world by herself, lost contact with her family while in the Indian Ocean.
Sunderland, from Thousand Oaks, California, had originally hoped to become the youngest person to sail around the world nonstop by herself.
She departed from Marina del Rey, California on January 23, 2010 and was about halfway through the attempt when Sunderland's family lost communication with her Thursday morning.
That night, an Australian plane was able to locate her 40-foot (12.2-metre) long boat, Wild Eyes, which had lost its mast earlier.
Sunderland had been sailing amid a rough storm in the Indian Ocean early Thursday when her boat was flipped over.
After losing contact, the teenager activated two manual distress radiobeacons, or EPIRBs, and a search-and-rescue operation was formed.
As part of the operation, a Qantas Airways Airbus A330 was sent over the ocean by Australian authorities.
The plane's crew was able to make radio contact with Sunderland, and confirmed that she was not injured and that her boat was upright, but was unable to continue sailing.
The closest rescue boat, a French fishing ship, was about 24 hours away from Sunderland's location when she was found, and is expected to meet her later today.
She was stranded about 2000 miles (3218.7 kilometres) southwest of Australia's coast.
Near the beginning of the voyage, she made a stop at Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, after the boat's generators were not producing enough power.
She resumed the attempt in February, but autopilot problems forced another stop at Cape Town, South Africa for repairs in April, and she had to give up going for the unassisted record.
Sunderland's parents, Laurence and Marianne, have vigorously defended against claims that their daughter was too young to be attempting such a feat.
They have also been criticized for allowing her to depart the United States at the beginning of the year, because Sunderland would likely arrive in the Indian Ocean during the region's winter.
Marianne Sunderland has said that Abby would likely not try something of this magnitude again.
Last year, her brother Zac had completed a circumnavigation when he sailed solo around the world at the age of seventeen.
She had begun preparing for this journey at the age of thirteen.
With development of Microsoft's Internet Explorer 9 (IE9) browser almost complete, Microsoft announced on Friday that it is time for IE6 users to move away from the antiquated 10-year-old browser.
On a new website, The Internet Explorer 6 Countdown, Microsoft has launched an aggressive campaign to persuade users to stop using IE6 and update to a newer IE.
Its goal is to decrease IE6 users to less than one percent.
IE's various versions accounted for 70 percent of the market in 2009; this has dropped to approximately 56 percent today.
Mozilla Firefox, its main rival, has been actively increasing its market share while the recently released Google Chrome is also quickly gaining users.
PC World's recent analysis of its own web traffic statistics concluded, Usually, Internet Explorer is the #2 browser after Firefox, but over the past 30 days it's been #3, a couple of points behind Safari-and nearly tied with Chrome.
But if it isn't, and Chrome continues to surge, IE could fall to fourth place.
As they design their web pages for the newer browsers with advanced web technology and geared to the newest web core markup language HTML 5, they are forced to accommodate older out-of-date technology to support IE6 users.
Also, not mentioned on Microsoft's The Internet Explorer 6 Countdown site, are the numerous security vulnerabilities putting the browser at risk of being hacked.
The Internet security firm Secunia.com, has said that as of March 4, 2011, IE6 has 277 vulnerabilities; 39 percent of these are rated highly critical.
Microsoft says that the latest versions of Internet Explorer provide the user with enhanced protection from these attacks and threats.
Microsoft's Internet Explorer 6 is one of the most successful software products ever as measured by its durability and the massive numbers of people who have used it.
But it has outlived its usefulness, and Microsoft no longer wants to support it.
As the start date of the former Iraqi leader's trial approaches, the chief judge of the tribunal has stated that the fate of Saddam Hussein will be broadcast on live television.
In a statement to CNN, Iraqi national security advisor Muwaffaq Rubaie said that ...this is going to be a fair, just trial with a defense counsel in there, with a proper prosecuting counsel as well there...
The first charge, filed earlier this month, alleges Hussein's responsibility in the 1982 killing of 143 residents of Dujail, in which he was the target of a botched assassination attempt.
The tribunal, which was set up in December 2003, has been marred by delays.
There are accusations of bias from the defense counsel of Hussein, as well as fears for the judges' safety which have consistently pushed the trial back.
The defense team has challenged the tribunal's legitimacy and stated they have not been given enough time to prepare.
This concern has been echoed in the past by some human rights groups, It's really critical that it's done right, says Michael Posner, executive director of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.
For those who believe in international justice and accountability for human rights crimes, the trial of Saddam Hussein is a rare opportunity to test the system and make it work.
Many Iraqis, particularly Shia and Kurdish, want to see Hussein tried for chemical gas attacks on the Kurds in the 1980s.
In 1988, one of these chemical attacks killed as many as 5,000 people.
As well, many Iraqis want Hussein punished for reprisals against a Shia uprising in 1991.
The trial is set to begin on Wednesday, October 19th.
United States Presidential candidates Senators Barack Obama and John McCain each participated in a live forum broadcast from Saddleback Church in Lake Forest.
The forum, moderated by pastor Rick Warren, was scheduled to showcase the candidates to an evangelical segment of the population, who account for 26.3% of the American public.
During the forum the candidates were each individually asked a series of identical questions by the pastor, with Senator Barack Obama going first and Senator John McCain taking his turn second.
Senator McCain traveled to the church and waited in a green room while Obama was speaking, and by agreement did not listen to the questions or Senator Obama's responses.
When asked whom they believed were the three wisest people to rely on as president, Obama answered that his wife and grandmother were at the top of his list along with a mix of Republican and Democratic Senators.
McCain comprised his list of a range of people the architect of the troop surge in Iraq, General David Petraeus; Democratic Congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis; and the former CEO of eBay, Meg Whitman.
In response to being questioned about their toughest decisions in life, Obama answered that deciding to oppose the Iraq War in 2002 was his toughest, while McCain cited his refusal to leave his men behind in a POW camp in Vietnam when given the chance.
On some philosophical questions the candidates differed in their moral stances.
When asked when they believed individuals should be given human rights, Obama responded that the question was above [his] pay grade while McCain decisively replied that he believed it should occur at the moment of conception.
On the concept of evil, Obama related it to the situation in Darfur and on America's streets.
McCain related it to radical Islamic extremism relaying that he believed evil should be defeated.
He then promised that as president he would hunt Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell.
They both answered that the biggest moral dilemmas in their lives were personal mistakes they had made when they were younger.
For Obama, it was his drug use, for McCain it was his failed first marriage.
Both candidates were on the stage together briefly between the interviews and shook hands and hugged in a moment symbolic of Warren's call for civility at the beginning and end of the forum.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has stated that the cholera outbreak that has struck the African country of Zimbabwe seems to have passed its peak.
The WHO said that while data collection and verification remain a challenge throughout the country with the effect that weekly statistics are not always accurate or complete, the overall trend over the last 2 months is of a decreasing number of cases and deaths.
The overall trend over the last two months is of a decreasing number of cases and deaths, the WHO said.
The number of new cholera cases in the week ending March 14 was 2,076, almost half of the 3,812 infections reported the week before, and 8,000 per week in the beginning of February.
The WHO stated that the fatality rate per week dropped from a peak of 6% in January to 2.3% this month.
91,164 total cases were reported as of March 17 since the epidemic started in August of last year, with a total of 4,307 deaths.
The cholera epidemic is the deadliest in Africa for a decade and a half.
US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, after several months of controversy, today announced his resignation after 13 years of public service.
While he did not elaborate on the circumstances of his departure, he referred to his tenure as a remarkable journey and said he had lived the American dream.
Critics of the embattled Attorney General have called for his ousting for several months, largely over his conflicts with the US Congress over the Bush Administration's warrant-less wiretapping program, and his firing of nine US attorneys.
Observers have expressed surprise at the sudden announcement, as Gonzales had said as recently as the weekend of the 18th of August that he had planned to stay through the end of President Bush's second term.
Critics of the Attorney General, most notably Harry Reid, majority leader for the US Senate, have welcomed the announcement, as Gonzales had been one of the most controversial members of the Bush Administration.
President Bush spoke on his close friend's resignation saying that he has reluctantly accepted the resignation, but noted that Gonzales' name had been dragged through the mud for political reasons.
Throughout the recent controversy Bush has stood next to Gonzales.
Paul Clement, the current Solicitor General, will serve as the acting Attorney General until a replacement has been confirmed by the Senate.
The Peel P50, a single door, three wheel microcar went on display at New York's Ripley's Believe It or Not! Museum on Monday.
The Peel Engineering Company manufactured 50 to 100 of the one-seater vehicles which weighed 130 lb (59 kg), and are 52.8 in (134 cm) in length, 47 in (120 cm) in height and 39 in (99 cm) in width.
The little car can travel as fast as 38 mph (61 kph), and comes equipped with a handle on the car so the driver can pull the car to back up.
Only twenty of the vehicles have survived since 1963, and the original price of Â£199 has soared to approximately Â£40,000 (US$ 65,000) today.
Former governor of New York Hugh Carey has died at the age of 92.
Carey was the 51st governor of the state and held office from 1975 until 1982 as a Democrat.
During his tenure he held more power over the finances of New York City than any other governor, before or after Carey's term.
He saw the city through the financial crisis of the 1970's.
The office of current governor Andrew M. Cuomo announced the death.
In a statement, Cuomo said â€œGovernor Carey led our state during a time of great financial turmoil and pulled us back from the brink of bankruptcy and economic ruin.â€
Carey ran for Governor during the 1974 election after being urged by his wife Helen.
Helen was battling cancer and died 18 days before Carey announced his intentions to run.
During his first year in office, the state was in a financial crisis and banks had stopped giving the city access to credit due to a $5 billion deficit.
He managed to come to a agreement with the bankers that heavy spending cuts needed to be made.
Carey was a father of 14 children and grandfather to 25.
Two of his sons died in a car accident in 1969.
Another son, Paul became a commissioner for the Securities Exchange Commission and died in 2001 after a battle with cancer.
Prince Laurent of Belgium, the youngest son of King Albert II of Belgium, has been questioned last night by the federal police and is attending today's court session in Hasselt in a marine fraud case that has gripped Belgian media since last December.
He arrived in a Smart car and was accompanied by his lawyer and former politician Fred Erdman.
The case turns around funds of the Belgian Navy that have been used to beautify the Prince's villa in Tervuren.
In total, â‚¬ 2.2 million was supposedly diverted from the marine's purchasing services using false invoices.
Roughly â‚¬ 185 000 was allegedly used to paint the Prince's villa, install lights in the garden, for the purchase of carpet and furniture, and for his secretariat and for animal clinics the Prince supports via his Foundation.
Twelve marine officers and contractors are being accused of document fraud, collusion, bribery, embezzlement of government money etc. and could face 10 years in prison.
The money was part of the budget that wasn't spent at the end of the year, and which would flow back to the government if the army didn't spend it.
The Prince, who is also an officer in the navy, is being treated only as a witness in this case, there have been no charges against him.
The Attorney General in Hasselt Marc Rubens has said that there are no elements in the investigation that point to the fact that Laurent was aware of the affair, however several accused have contested this in the press.
Technically, the villa is not the property of the Prince himself, but of the Royal Gift, which manages the real property of the Royal Family.
During his interview by the police last night, Prince Laurent stated that he needed funds to renovate his villa, and that NoÃ«l Vaessen, his adviser, told him the Navy could help him.
The Prince stated that he thought it was legal, and that he had no reason to doubt his adviser.
Vaessen has declared in the media during the last month that the Prince actively participated in the fraud, and that he fears a cover-up.
He said that the Prince was a demanding party in the operation, and that he knew that we were arranging things to make his life and his work as comfortable as possible.
According to Vaessen, the Prince was in need of money to support a royal lifestyle, and didn't even have enough money to buy food.
In 2001, Vaessen was discharged with honour from the army for medical reasons, but Defence Minister AndrÃ© Flahaut is investigating if there was no agreement to give him his pension in exchange for the fact that he wouldn't incriminate the Prince.
Vaessen also accused the Prince of other things, such as racing against the high-speed train TGV on a French highway.
Captain Johan Claeys, one of the accused, studied with the Prince and worked at the facturation services of the Navy in 1998 and 1999.
One of the accused contractors, Marc Luypaerts, has told the press that the judge responsible for the investigation in Hasselt had forbidden him to speak about Prince Laurent.
Laurent's status as a Prince has several judicial consequences for the trial.
In Belgium, it's against the law to incriminate the Royal Family during a trial.
Also, the Prince is protected from judicial pursuit because he is also a Senator by law.
Justice Minister Laurette Onkelinx has issued a Royal Decrete, which the King has signed while on holiday in Napels, which would make it possible for Princes to testify in a trial.
However, Public Prosecutor Erwin Steyls has chosen to have Laurent interrogated by the police last night in Hasselt.
This was the first time during the last six years of the inquiry that the Prince was questioned.
Today in the court, the Prosecutor defended the act of having him questioned outside the trial, saying that there were several procedural issues.
First, the subpoena for the Prince wasn't issued in time to be legal.
Second, the details of the protocol to hear the Prince in court were not explained in the recent Royal Decrete, making it worthless -something Minister Onkelickx denied.
Thirdly, nobody can be forced to testify against himself, and if the Prince were to make false statements under oath, he could only be sued for perjury.
However, the court has decided to let him testify anyway this afternoon.
During the last month, the case has caused a several spin-off discussions in Belgium.
One of the surprises during this period was the King's Christmas Message, in which he referred to the case.
The regional governments are now investigating and discussing their donations to the IRGTKINT, an environmental organisation supported by Prince Laurent.
But there is also an ongoing debate over the position of the Monarchy in Belgium.
Some politicians are suggesting to limit the role of the Monarchy, and other think that only the King and Queen, the Crown Prince or Princess and the widow(er) of the King or Queen should receive state funding.
Controversy was sparked by his choice of conservative Italian Rocco Buttiglione for the Justice Commissioner position, who made several statements regarding homosexuality and women that members of the European Parliament objected to.
The European Parliament voted in favour the Commissioners on November 18th, giving Barroso and his staff the green light to start their official five-year term starting on Monday.
While the Greens, Eurosceptics and the Communist Party voted against, the Commission secured the approval of the Parliament's biggest parties - the Socialists, the Liberals and the European People's Party.
The vote ended with 449 in favour, 149 against and 82 abstentions, CNN reports.
According to senior officials in the Obama administration, the U.S. is to significantly and permanently reduce its stockpile of nuclear weapons by thousands of weapons as part of a major rethinking of American nuclear policy.
The move is coming as part of a major policy review intended to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons around the world.
According to an unnamed official, the review will point to dramatic reductions in the stockpile, while maintaining a strong and reliable deterrent.
As part of the new policy, conventional weapons will have a greater role in the future.
According to officials, there are thousands of weapons that could be retired, largely by eliminating those currently stored.
The move comes as a significant step towards Obama's stated goal of reducing and eventually ending the spread of nuclear weapons worldwide.
The policy changes come as part of the Nuclear Posture Review, a document which is undertaken by all presidents.
In addition to the reduction of nuclear weapons, Obama's review will also adjust the United States' defense towards non-nuclear options, including missile defense, largely within striking distance of the Persian Gulf to reduce the threat posed by countries such as Iran.
A centerpiece of the new policy is a new plan called the Prompt Global Strike, which involves a new type of conventional weapon that could be fired from the U.S. and reach anywhere in the world within an hour, providing an effective option for attacks worldwide, such as against a missile launch from North Korea or a strike against Al-Qaeda in Pakistan.
The new weapons would achieve the same effects as nuclear weapons, without the threat of conventional war escalating into nuclear war.
The changes reflect a new focus on nonproliferation and arms control by the Obama administration, policies that were largely dismissed by the Bush administration.
In conjunction with new domestic policies, the Obama administration is trying to win passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which would ban all nuclear explosions for any purposes.
The treaty was defeated in the 1990s, during the Clinton presidency, and still faces strong resistance in the U.S. Senate.
The Obama administration is also trying to revise the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to close loopholes that have been exploited by North Korea and Iran.
The administration has also been pressured to redefine the role of America's nuclear arsenal.
Democrats have been pressuring the administration to formally declare that the role of America's nuclear weapons is solely to deter nuclear attack on the United States.
American military officials, as well as some officials within the White House, however, have urged the administration to retain more ambiguous wording from the Bush era, which says that nuclear deterrence is only the primary role of American nuclear weapons, which would leave open the option of using nuclear weapons against enemies that threaten the US with chemical or biological weapons.
Tera Myers, a former actress in pornographic films, has left her position as a science teacher at Parkway North High School in St. Louis County, Missouri after her past was revealed by a student.
This marks the second such controversy involving Myers, also known under the names Tericka Dye and the stage name Rikki Anderson.
She was suspended by Kentucky's McCracken County Public Schools system in 2006 after her career in pornography was made public.
Don Senti, interim superintendent of the district, said Myers was on administrative leave from her position at the school at her own request.
Myers' request, granted out of respect for her privacy and that of her family, came after a student inquired about her pornographic career.
The district said Myers passed background checks before being hired as a teacher in 2007, but it did not know about her past until the student found out about it online, because her career in the pornography industry was legal.
A Parkway representative said the Kentucky school at which Myers last worked was contacted in 2007 to verify her references, but no mention of her suspension or stint in pornography was provided.
Myers will continue to be paid until the end of the semester, at which time she is to leave the Parkway School District.
According to Tandy, Dye was concerned about the impact it would have in the building, and, on March 4, informed the school's principal of her past after being asked by the student.
Myers also was the coach of the girls' volleyball at Parkway North High School.
Myers previously taught at Reidland High School in Paducah, Kentucky, and was suspended in 2006 after a student there discovered her pornographic career.
That May, Myers defended herself, saying, Anybody who has been in my classroom could tell you how much I love teaching and how much I love these students, and that should be what matters more than anything in my past.
Known as Tericka Dye at the time, she protested against her dismissal and even appeared on the Dr. Phil talk show.
Myers said she became involved in the adult industry after working as an impoverished exotic dancer in California.
Late last month, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) filed objections to the United States Government's 'secret' attempts to obtain Twitter account information relating to WikiLeaks.
The ACLU and EFF cite First and Fourth amendment issues as overriding reasons to overturn government attempts to keep their investigation secret; and, that with Birgitta Jonsdottir being an Icelandic Parliamentarian, the issue has serious international implications.
The case, titled In the Matter of the 2703(d) Order Relating to Twitter Accounts Wikileaks, Rop_G, IOERROR; and BirgittaJ, has been in the EFF's sights since late last year when they became aware of the US government's attempts to investigate WikiLeaks-related communications using the popular microblogging service.
That was said by some, especially from nationalistic and populist parties, such as Peace and Justice, and Self-Defense and League of Polish Families, candidates in the last elections (both parliamentary and presidential), who had been promising people a strengthening of the position of Polish president.
He was unable to stand for re-election again as the Constitution of Poland states that the Polish president can only be re-elected once.
The head of the Israel Defense Forces, Lt. Gen. Dan Halutz, resigned on Tuesday January 16, 2007 after an internal review criticized his military's leadership during the war in Lebanon last summer.
Halutz sent his resignation letter to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, which according to Israeli Army Radio said, For me, the concept of responsibility is everything.
Halutz has also been facing criticism after it was disclosed that he sold a portion of his stock portfolio hours after the Lebanon fighting began on July 12, 2006.
The slow moving, and wavering between hurricane status and tropical storm Ophelia, crawled up the U.S. coastline from northern Florida on what appears to be a track for landfall on Thursday near Cape Lookout, North Carolina on the Outer Banks of North Carolina.
Ophelia gained some strength to a Category 1 hurricane over the last 24 hours while on its north-northeast track to side-swipe the protruding coastline of the Carolinas.
Power outages were reported with sustained winds of 80 mph and rain, up to 6 inches, in the southeast portion of the state.
Ocean Isle Beach closed a bridge to the barrier islands due to the rough surf conditions created by Ophelia.
Residents and tourists had been ordered on Sunday to evacuate Ocracoke by governor Michael F. Easley.
Tourists on Hatteras Island were also ordered to leave, but earlier on Monday, emergency officials for Dare County decided against an ordered evacuation for the northern portion of the Outer Banks.
Weaker tropical and hurricane storms such as Ophelia have in the past still caused major damage from flooding in North Carolina's barrier islands from winds stirring up the shallow sound waters between the mainlaind and Outer Banks.
Further inland from the storm, except for the possibility of thunderstorms, little effect from Ophelia is expected.
Virginia's governor Mark R. Warner declared a state of emergency on Monday as a precaution.
Nearly two dozen F-15 fighter jets were moved from Hampton's Langley Air Force base out of Ophelia's way to Florida.
A team of scientists at Stanford University claim to have detected a subtle, missing element of Einstein's theory of relativity.
In a press release dated February 16th, Robert Kahn, Stanford University's Public Affairs Coordinator, announced the experimental confirmation of frame dragging, an effect in which the presence of a rotating body causes space itself to be pulled along as the body rotates.
While the effect was theorized by Josef Lense and Hans Thirring as far back as 1918, the small scale of the effect, as little as one part in a trillion for a satellite orbiting the Earth, made detecting the effect difficult.
The observation was made by the Gravity Probe B satellite, which carries finely-machined gyroscopes.
Scientists looked for small changes in the motion of the gyroscopes to detect the frame dragging effect, as well as the much larger geodetic effect â€“ small corrections to the Earth's gravitational field due to differences between Einstein's and Newton's theories of gravity.
The experiment was conducted on the satellite from 2004 to 2005.
However, the complexity of the data analysis along with unforeseen engineering problems have made finding the effect in the experiment's results difficult.
In particular, the presence of small electrical charges on the gyroscopes interfered with their results.
Francis Everitt, the experiment's Principal Investigator, stresses in an interview with the New York Times that their announcement is only preliminary and that, with further analysis, they hope to improve the precision of their results; currently, they say they have only detected the frame dragging effect to within plus or minus fifteen percent of its expected value.
The theory of general relativity was developed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century to explain the behavior of moving objects in space, after the discovery that the speed of light was always the same no matter how the person measuring it was moving.
While it successfully explains many strange behaviors in space, such as the slow shifting of the orbit of Mercury and the bending of light by massive objects such as black holes, testing the theory on Earth has always been difficult due to the small scale of relativity's effects in everyday life.
The 'Invitational Games for the Deaf, Taipei 2008' started yesterday in Taipei, Taiwan.
After table tennis and soccer, events from martial arts including karate, judo, and taekwondo were featured mainly in the 2nd matchday.
Unlike the taekwondo event which applied a single elimination rule, events from karate and judo applied round robin rules in their competitions.
A University of Georgia marketing professor has allegedly killed three people and injured two others today in the southeastern United States.
The shooting took place approximately 1225 p.m around the Athens Community Theater in the Athens-Clarke County, in the northeast part of Georgia.
Authorities suspect George Zinkhan in the shooting and have issued a nationwide alert for him and his 2005 red Jeep Liberty with Georgia license plate AIX1376.
The Atlanta Journal Constitution (AJC) reports that two handguns were found at the scene.
Athens-Clarke County Police Captain Clarence Holeman reported that two others were injured by shrapnel, and the extent of their injuries is unknown.
A discussion took place before an evening performance between the alleged shooter and one of the victims.
The AJC reports that the victims were Marie Bruce, 47, Ben Teague, 63, and Tom Tanner, 40.
Clarke County coroner Sonny Wilson said Saturday night that all three were shot multiple times.
Bruce was the wife of the alleged shooter and president of the theater company, while the others were part of a production of Sherlock Holmes The Final Adventure.
Tanner was performing in the production, and Teague was a member of the production crew.
Police also report that Zinkhan was involved in an argument with an unidentified man before the shooting occurred.
According to Capt. Clarence Holeman of the Athens-Clarke County Police Dept., the two people wounded suffered non-life-threatening injuries and were taken to St. Mary's Hospital in Athens.
Holeman also confirmed that both victims were injured by ricochet one in the leg and one in the foot.
Zinkhan is reported to have left his two youngest children in the car while at theater, and then left to drop them off at the home of his his neighbor Robert Covington.
Zinkhan reportedly told Covington that there had been an emergency and would be gone for about an hour.
Our first thoughts are for safety of the university community and for prompt apprehension of the person responsible.
Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of all those who have been affected, University of Georgia President Michael F. Adams said in an official statement.
Matt Hardy, 22 years old, was at the scene of the crime, and had seen his friend Tom Tanner being shot twice.
His father John Hardy commented to reporters that at 22 you're not supposed to watch people die.
Matt Hardy spoke to investigators and departed with his parents.
The university sent text messages and e-mails to students advising them of the potentially dangerous situation.
Police are requesting that anyone who comes in contact with the suspect dial 911 and exercise extreme caution.
Zinkhan has been described as a 57-year-old Caucasian with a goatee-style beard and full mustache.
He has blue eyes and brown hair worn above the ear according to his most recent photograph.
He was reported to have been wearing blue shorts with a polo shirt at the time of the shooting, and he may be driving the red Jeep.
The BBC has reported that 8000 schools have been fully or partially closed by todayâ€™s national UK teachers strike.
The majority of state schools in the city of Bristol are closing for the strike, although many of the schools for students age 16+ are expected to remain open.
Some schools that originally said they would be closed have made the decision not to close for the strike.
The Guardian reports that the strike, which is expected to take place on Thursday, will be the first national teachers' strike in 21 years.
Earlier this week, John Dunford from the Association of School and College Leaders told The Guardian that Most secondary schools will be partially closed; a thousand could close.
Republicans and lobbyists close to President George W. Bush have reported that the White House will propose changing the formula for establishing initial Social Security benefit levels in order to cut guaranteed expenditures on future retirees, according to today's Washington Post.
The Social Security Administration would no longer use the increase in wages over a workerâ€™s lifetime to calculate retireesâ€™ first-year benefits but would use inflation rates instead.
The new â€œprice indexingâ€ formula will reduce individual benefits and overall Social Security outlays because the inflation rate typically is much lower than the rise in wages.
The full impact of the change will be felt in the middle of the century.
The Bush Administration proposal, which will be offered to Congress in February or March 2005, is part of an overall Social Security reform package that also would create â€œpersonal investment accountsâ€ into which individual taxpayers could divert part of their payroll taxes.
The White House believes that the shortfall in benefits created by the adoption of price indexing would be made up by capital gains from the stocks and bonds held by individual taxpayers in their personal investment accounts.
The move is akin to the private sector's migration from defined benefit retirement plans to defined contribution benefit plans such as 401(k)s as almost half of a workerâ€™s benefits will not be guaranteed by the year 2075.
President Bush will support the move to price indexing for calculating initial benefits by pointing out that it was the approach recommended by his 2001 Commission to Strengthen Social Security.
Benefits currently are calculated by averaging a workerâ€™s earnings in their 35 highest-paid years and adjusting earnings to factor in cost of living standards at the workerâ€™s retirement age.
Under the Bush proposal, rather than adjusting benefits on the basis of earnings growth, the calculation would be based on the increase in the consumer price index over those years.
The implementation of price indexing would cut future Social Security costs by trillions of dollars.
However, the cuts in guaranteed benefits for middle-class and some high-income workers would be substantial 9.9% for workers retiring in 2022, over 25% for workers retiring in 2042, and 46% for workers retiring in 2075.
Opponents of the price-indexing proposal point out that inflation-based calculations of benefits, by linking benefits to prices but not wage levels, would cut retirees out from future increases in living standards since it is wages and not prices that determine standards of living.
While American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) Policy Director John Rother concedes that many of the arguments of opponents are valid, price indexing is inevitable and must be viewed in the context of President Bushâ€™s total reform package.
Rother points out that Social Security benefits, which currently equal 42 percent of the earnings of an average worker retiring at age 65, would be reduced to 20% of pre-retirement earnings for future retirees, thus potentially freezing retirees into todayâ€™s standard of living.
However, Rother says that price indexing has to be linked to Bushâ€™s private investment accounts as income from the accounts give retirees the chance to make up the shortfalls.
International Labor Day, or May Day, has been marked by protests throughout Switzerland.
Roughly 12,000 protesters organized across the country, rallying against the dismantling of social welfare, as well as wage dumping and the large salaries of top company officials.
The protests were peaceful, although minor skirmishes did occur in Zurich and Lucerne.
These usually involved clashes between left and right extremists rather than with authorities.
In one case, bottles and fireworks were used as weapons, but no injuries were reported.
Protesters in Geneva demand reform regarding illegal immigration, and equality for men and women.
In Zurich trade unions urged the free movement of people, as well as an ending to the pressure on salaries.
Vasco Pedrina, Co-president of the union Unia, called the difference between high and low incomes a existential and human tragedy.
Pedrina and others, including Bern mayor Alexander TschÃ¤ppÃ¤t, spoke out during the Saturday and Sunday period of protests.
A recently published nationwide survey of US teenagers indicates boys tend to masturbate more â€” and start younger â€” than girls.
It also finds boys who masturbate are more likely to engage in safe sex than boys who don't.
Dr. Cynthia L. Robbins, the study's lead author from Indiana University in Indianapolis, spoke of the need for the academic community to focus more on masturbation.
Many adolescent boys and girls masturbate, and among sexually active teens masturbation is associated with other sexual behaviors and condom use.
It is important to recognize that masturbation is an important and normal component of adolescent sexual development.
The survey, named the National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior (NSSHB), was supported by Church & Dwight, which makes Trojan condoms.
A representative nationwide sample of 820 teens 14â€“17 years old participated in the study with parental permission.
The findings were published Monday in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine.
Male and female respondents were asked to note how frequently they masturbated in the past three months, the past year, and throughout their lifetime.
They were also asked to recall whether they masturbated alone or with a partner, and also how often they used condoms.
Nearly three-fourths of boys reported having masturbated, compared to only less than half of girls.
About half of boys reported masturbating twice or more per week, also higher than the 23 percent of girls.
Masturbation rates for both genders increased along with age, though only boys were more likely to report having recently engaged in the activity as they grew older.
Among adolescents who engage in oral or vaginal sex, boys who masturbate were eight times more likely to use a condom than boys who don't.
The researchers who conducted the study urge more open and educational discussion of this highly stigmatized topic.
The findings of this study together with existing publications on masturbation should be used by health care providers to inform, educate and reassure adolescents about masturbation to provide competent and comprehensive sexuality education in the clinical setting.
May 27, 2005 Mount Qomolangma, known in the west as Mount Everest, may be taller than ever, and a group of 24 Chinese researchers have scaled the peak and made observations they hope will document its current height.
In 1975 the peak was surveyed at a height of 8 848 metres, in line with previous calculations, but a U.S. survey team in 1999 measured it at 8 850m.
The growth to some extent fits current theories regarding the geology of the region, a region with crustal upthrust.
The growth may also be due in part to rapid glacier retreat on the peak's slopes, and the mountain springing back as the weight of snow melts and runs off.
At the same time, recent theories suggest the mountain is also shrinking.
The peak may be getting smaller from subsidence as it reaches extreme heights, and again the glaciers and snow help to stabilize and expand the mountain itself.
There is some disagreement regarding the methods of measurement used previously, so the researchers spent an hour at the summit taking measurements using radar, satellite, and other methods on 6 points.
The average of the measurements will be used to make the official Chinese measurement, which remains at 8 848.
Results of the expedition are expected to be available in August.
A previous measurement team from Italy also used the radar methodology in 2004, but their results have not yet been published.
The mountain straddles the border between Tibet and Nepal, and is known by several names.
In Chinese, ç ç©†æœ—ç‘ªå³° (pinyin ZhÅ«mÃ¹lÇŽngmÇŽ FÄ“ng); Tibetan Qomolangma (Mother of the Universe); in Nepal Sagarmatha (Forehead of the Sky); and in English named after Sir George Everest.
In a conscience vote last night, Wednesday, parliament decided that the alcohol purchasing for New Zealanders will not be raised to 20 but instead will stay at the current age of 18.
The vote was 72-49 with the noes as the majority, a conscience vote is where the individual Member of Parliament (MP) votes instead of the party and their policies.
The bill was brought before Parliament with the intent of placing the drinking age back at 20 following its lowering to 18 in 1999.
It was first drafted by Matt Robson of the NZ Progressive Party, and was then taken on by Martin Gallagher from the New Zealand Labour Party.
However, the Labour-led government is being attacked for interfering with the liquor purchase age bill.
Before the debate on the bill, two ministers who are against raising the age, justice minister Mark Burton and associate health minister, Damien O'Conner both announced that they would fully review the salesupply of liquor to people below the age of 18, regardless of whether the bill were passed or not.
The review will most likely look at how many off-licence outlets there are and increased law enforcement of the drink age.
Mr Burton said that he did not pre-empt the bill voting, he said It was important to ensure all options were on the table before the vote.
What we are saying is you can have confidence that if the bill doesn't proceed there will be an alternative vehicle for addressing the issues immediately thereafter.
Many MPs said that it was unorthodox to intrude in such a manner in the voting process.
Leader of Jim Anderton's Progressive coalition and supporter of the bill, Jim Anderton, said Making a last-minute plea to MPs is not to be fooled by the promise of the unnecessary review.
This is the review you have when you want to give parliamentarians a soft option.
And I hear that sigh of relief in many places, 'oh gosh you've got a review so we don't have to make a hard decision'.
Well this is the place for hard decisions and this is where the buck stops.
Christopher Bishop, a spokesman for the Keep it 18 campaign, said We welcome the Government's moves to review the supply of alcohol to minors in the likely event that the Sale of Liquor Amendment Bill is defeated today.
Raising the drinking age is never going to work as a way of dealing with New Zealand's drinking culture.
It is a simplistic and knee-jerk solution â€“ a legislative sledgehammer.
Chester Burrows, National MP, said My experience is I've seen too many pissed young people, raped young people, assaulted young people.
Gordon Copeland, United Future MP, who also preferred the split age, said he had no doubt the move would influence the way people voted.
Ron Mark, New Zealand First MP, said Are we going to do something, or are we going to do nothing asked New Zealand First list MP Ron Mark.
We can at least let this bill go through to the next stage.
Ross Bell, spokesman for the Drug Foundation, said Not only is such a review too narrow, it also seemed to pre-empt the outcome of Wednesday's debate.
A cynical person might think the announcement gave MPs an excuse not to support the bill.
That review has already been looked at by the Law and Order Select Committee, and what is needed is a review of price and availability of alcohol.
However it has been suggested by the select committee previously researching the drinking problem in New Zealand that there is little hard evidence 18 & 19 year olds are buying alcohol for minors, with the largest problem instead being the purchasing of alcohol by parents for their children.
A rupture in the underground stormwater drain system opened a huge sinkhole on February 23, killing three people and bringing down twelve houses in Guatemala City.
Teenagers Irma and David Soyos and their father, 53-year old Domingo Soyos were killed when their house collapsed into the sinkhole.
Nearly a thousand people were evacuated from the San Antonio neighborhood after the collapse.
Wikinews interviewed Eric Haddox, a civil engineer who has visited the site of the sinkhole and spoken to the engineers working on fixing the drain.
Mr. Haddox, who specialises in the building of earthworks, roads, water supply and sewage systems, and is working as a missionary in Guatemala, visited the site following the collapse to help in the recovery effort.
Mr. Haddox told us that the size of the hole is much smaller than the 330 feet depth originally reported and that the erosion causing the collapse is believed to have happened over a long time, and not just during the recent rains as initially suspected.
There are also concerns that a four-story building less than a metre from the edge of the hole may collapse as the earth under the building continues to be eroded.
The Scottish National Party (SNP), which supports Scottish independence from the UK, has pulled off a historic, albeit narrow, victory in yesterday's Scottish elections.
In the third Scottish election since the opening of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, the left of centre SNP beat the ruling Labour Party by a single seat.
It won 47 seats, while Labour won 46, down from the current 50.
It is the first time since the parliament opened that Labour has been beaten, and the first time in fifty years that they have not had a majority of Scottish constituency seats in any election.
SNP leader Alex Salmond declared Scotland has changed for good and forever.
He added that the Labour Party had lost the moral authority to govern Scotland.
The current First Minister of Scotland, Jack McConnell of Labour said While I recognise that the SNP are the largest party by the narrowest of margins, Alex Salmond must himself recognise that he does not have a majority in the Scottish Parliament or anywhere near a majority of the vote.
It is believed that many factors caused the Labour vote to slump and the SNP vote to rise, including the war in Iraq and the renewal of Trident, which are both unpopular in Scotland.
The election also raises a serious dilemma for the Labour party's Gordon Brown, a Scotsman widely tipped to succeed Tony Blair as the next prime minister of the United Kingdom.
Brown is vehement in his support of the Union, and is a Westminster (London parliament) MP for Kirkcaldy.
An SNP government in Scotland will find itself facing the very Labour party it beat in power in London.
Hifikepunye Pohamba, the president of the southern African country of Namibia, declared a state of emergency in in the country on Tuesday after heavy flooding killed 92 and displaced 5,032 since January.
100,000 children were unable to attend classes due to the disaster, which closed 218 schools.
Severe flooding occurred in Namibia about the same time last year, when 42 people were killed by the disaster.
This year's floods appear to be worse, as President Pohamba stated that the Zambezi River had reached 7.1 metres, compared to last year's peak of 5.37 metres.
Flooding has also reached neighbouring Angola, where nineteen people have died, according to the Red Cross.
Wednesday morning, the Frankfurt Book Fair opened its gates to the first of an estimated 280,000 visitors this year in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.
The Frankfurt Book Fair is the biggest book fair in the world.
It also organises the participation of German publishers at more than 25 international book fairs and is the co-founder of the Cape Town Book Fair in South Africa.
It maintains the most visited website worldwide for the publishing industry.
The German Publishers & Booksellers Association, which runs the Frankfurt Book Fair, says that the book market is thriving.
It declared on Tuesday that the high number of exhibitors and the record numbers of 7,448 exhibitors from over 100 countries, showing 391,652 books, including 121,267 new books of this year, proves that the book market is thriving.
TV and merchandising rights have long played a role, but have become more and more important for larger projects.
Two other media forms have also become more standard elements of the value chain.
E-books and audiobooks are both big topics of this year's Book Fair.
Fighting words were exchanged in the Australian House of Representatives over the matter of the division of Medicare safety net payments per electorate.
The Minister for Health and Ageing Tony Abbott (Liberal, Warringah) had introduced a policy that the Government would pay Medicare users up to a fixed amount â€” the safety net â€” to help in addressing gaps in certain payments which Medicare would not cover, such as certain hospital payments.
The Opposition was opposed to the idea on efficacy counts.
Abbott was asked a Dorothy Dixer in Question Time today about the benefits of the safety net.
He alleged that criticism by the Opposition Health spokeswoman Julia Gillard (Labor, Lalor) that the safety net favoured LiberalNational Party coalition electorates was misleading as it was a Labor electorate, Grayndler that received the highest safety net benefits per electorate.
This led Gillard to make a personal explanation after Question Time, stating that the top four electorates receiving money under the Medicare safety net are Wentworth, North Sydney, Bradfield and Warringah â€” all coalition electorates.
The Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley (Labor, Brand), put a question to the Speaker of the House, David Hawker (Liberal, Wannon) asking of the Speaker his assurance that no person is being deliberately misled by the actions of any other person.
Abbott had then interjected towards Beazley, saying You big bellowing cow; the Speaker asked Abbott to withdraw, but Abbott mentioned that the Leader of the Opposition regularly interjects 'pompous ass' and 'goose', but I am happy to withdraw.
Beazley then responded through the Speaker saying of Abbott, I think that he is a sleazy, dummy-spitting, little git.
Abbott then made a personal explanation of his own, saying The safety net benefit per person in the electorate of the member for Grayndler was $591, the highest in New South Wales...the safety net benefit in the electorate of Sydney was $589, the second highest...the benefit in the electorate of Lowe was $458, the third highest.
The matter was not further raised at the time, but after the Matter of Public Importance debate, Gillard moved a motion to suspend standing orders which would prevent Abbott from explaining his earlier claim when this claim is totally untrue, to correct the grossly inaccurate and misleading statement, to apologise to all Members in this place and to apologize to the Member for Grayndler and his constituents.
Gillard also listed the amounts of payments released by the Minister himself, that Wentworth received $7.8 million, North Sydney received $7.5 million, Bradfield received $6.9 million, Warringah received $6.3 million; whereas Grayndler received only $3.6 million.
She attempted to debate the motion but a gag motion to silence Gillard was moved and won because of Government numbers.
Anthony Albanese, the Labor member for Grayndler attempted to second the motion but the gag was moved on him as well.
The final vote on the motion was lost 55 to 79.
In the gold medal match at water polo's FINA World League Final tonight between the Australia Stingers and United States women's national water polo team, Australia lost 4â€“6 to the USA in the last major competition before the 2012 Summer Olympics.
The victory made for seven World League Super Final titles for Team USA.
At 700 p.m. Chinese local time, 900 p.m. Australian local time, the game got under way, with a Tweet from Australian Water Polo for fans at home who could not watch the game live.
The Australians were down at quarter time, 1â€“2 with the team's only goal coming from Bronwen Knox off a pass by Kate Gynther.
By half time, Australia had battled back to take the lead 4â€“3, only to finish the third period tied 4â€“4 with the United States, and eventually lose 4â€“6.
In the lead up to the World League Final, the Australians spent time in Singapore before departing for China.
While in Singapore, players had an opportunity to relax at the pool and several, including Knox, Rowena Webster, Nicola Zagame, and Melissa Rippon were very active on Twitter.
The team arrived in Shanghai and the Shanghai Institute of Sport a week before the start of the FINA Super League Finals.
During their week-long preparation, they worked on strength and fitness training.
When away from the pool, they did not have access to Twitter, Facebook, or television and had to entertain themselves using other means.
Players finally explored the city six days after their arrival.
With limited opportunities for amusement in the hotel room during the competition, assistant coach Ryan Moar updated his Twitter account and played with a toy helicopter.
Several of the players who were active on Twitter before departing for China stopped updating, including Webster, Rippon, and Zagame.
Knox and Moran continued to provide updates on Twitter and Instagram throughout the competition.
Australian game days during the tournament included warming up poolside before the start of their games, and cooling down in the pool after them.
Going into their match against the USA, they notched an 8â€“7 victory over China, an 18 to nil victory against Germany, and a 9â€“7 overtime shootout win against Russia.
On gold medal game day, Jane Moran updated her Twitter account to say Final of World League Super Finals today v USA - goooo Stingers! â€ª#stingerspride.
About eight hours prior to game time, the team finished their final training session.
Earlier in the afternoon, prior to game time in Australia, Channel 9 ran a feature on the team.
Prior to the start of the game, the Australian Stingers official team Twitter account mocked Team USA for their team-branded k tape.
During the pre-game warm up, team members did a variety of things including playing with their phones, warming up, and getting their arms taped.
It was business as usual for the team that had beaten the United States the previous month at the VISA Water Polo International.
The bronze medal match between the China women's national water polo team and Greece women's national water polo team preceded the gold medal game, which Greece won 8â€“7, with quarter scoring of 1â€“2 in the first, 4â€“2 in the second, 1â€“2 in the third, and 1â€“2 in the fourth.
In the other match, the Russia women's national water polo team easily beat the Germany women's national water polo team 18-4.
NASA has said that preliminary investigations show that Discovery is safe to fly home.
Final findings will not be available for several days as a team of 200 experts study all video and stills footage taken of the shuttle during launch, and on approach to the International Space Station (ISS), with which Discovery docked earlier today.
Images from new cameras have revealed that a section of foam weighing some 250 g fell away from the external fuel tank during launch, but did not strike the Orbiter.
However, NASA has announced the grounding of all further planned Shuttle launches until they have a firm understanding of why the foam comes away, and what to do about it.
A piece of foam striking the Columbia's wing during take-off in January 2003 was responsible for the loss of the craft as it made its reentry to Earth's atmosphere.
As part of the check for damage the crew of Discovery used a laser-scanner on the robotic arm to inspect the craft's wing leading-edges and nosecone.
The belly of the Orbiter will be checked later this week.
In a first, the Shuttle also performed a slow back-flip in some 180 m from the ISS enabling the two-man crew of the space station to take high-resolution images of the underside of the Orbiter.
Chelsea beat Liverpool in extra time to advance to next month's UEFA Champions League Final in Moscow.
Liverpool goalkeeper Jose Reina punched away Michael Ballack's shot which landed at the feet of Didier Drogba who capitalized by scoring the opening goal of the 2nd leg.
Fernando Torres equalized in the 2nd half after Yossi Benayoun beat the defenders to set up the goal.
After Chelsea were denied a goal by the Assistant Referee moments earlier, Referee awarded Chelsea a penalty shot which Frank Lampard converted.
Dider Drogba added Chelsea's 3rd goal of the 2nd leg.
Ryan Babbel brought Liverpool within a goal of advancing with 3 minutes of extra time remaining.
The win for Chelsea means that they have made their 1st ever UEFA Champions League final and will be competing in the 1st ever all-English final in UEFA Champions League history.
In an effort to ease complaints by the U.S. and Europe about a heavy influx of low priced Chinese goods, China will raise export tariffs on 74 categories of textile products in June.
This follows plans from the U.S. to impose quotas on Chinese textiles and clothing.
Products likely to see an increase from the Chinese move include synthetic fiber shirts, trousers, knit shirts and blouses, cotton shirts, and combined cotton yarn.
Last week, similar restrictions were imposed by the U.S. on cotton trousers, knit shirts, and underwear.
Currently, a 2.5 cent charge per item is imposed; the new tariff will raise this to the equivalent of 12 cents per piece now.
While this is a fourfold increase, it is not expected to affect consumer prices.
Because of this, some doubt the tariff will have any effect on correcting the trade imbalance.
This move is in response to U.S. trade quotas imposed due to concerns that increased Chinese goods would put U.S. textile manufacturers out of business.
According to Auggie Tantillo, executive director of the American Manufacturing Trade Action Coalition, a textile industry group in the U.S., the move will preserve 10,000 U.S. jobs.
The new U.S. trade quota will limit the growth of Chinese textile imports to 7.5 percent compared with shipments over the past year.
Prior to January 1, a global quota system helped regulate the trade.
With the quota system gone, fears have arisen that a flood of Chinese goods could undercut U.S. competitiveness in the market.
China is able to market its goods cheaply due to an artificially weak yuan.
The U.S. Treasury criticized the China yuan policy as highly distortionary, posing a major risk to China's economy itself and to global economic growth.
They challenged China to revalue its currency to bring it to a level they believe will allow fairer competition between global manufacturers.
Chinese Commerce Minister Bo Xilai said, I believe they are not reasonable.
Laura Jones, a representative of large retailers, also criticized the move, saying These restrictions on imports from China will do absolutely nothing to help the U.S. textile industry -- and the government knows it.
Omar Bongo, the president of the western African country of Gabon, has died at a clinic in Barcelona, Spain, according to the Gabonese prime minister.
Jean Eyeghe Ndong said that Bongo, the longest-serving leader of an African country, had died at the Quiron clinic on Monday, at the age of 73.
At 230 pm, the medical team informed me, as well as the officials and members of the family present, that the president of the republic, head of state Omar Bongo Ondimba had just passed away following a heart attack, Ndong said, adding that the president had been admitted to the clinic early in May.
I noted at that time that the head of state whom I visited in the intensive care unit was alive and well.
But we knew that the health of the president had become a source of concern in recent days, he said.
According to Gabon's constitution, the president of the senate is to become the interim ruler should the president die while in office.
The senate's president is Rose Francine Rogombe from the Gabonese Democratic Party.
The constitution says new elections should take place within 45 days.
Tom Cruise this week took the delivery service to a whole new level.
Celebrating his 43rd birthday with numerous guests at a party in the USA, Cruise decided to call up his three favorite chefs, all living in Italy, to prepare a meal.
Cruise decided to fly all three chefs out to the United States at a cost of â‚¬14,500.
According to the Daily Mail the chefs cooked the celebrity tagliatelle ragu, veal, and chocolate tiramisu.
Australia, Japan, South Korea and the Netherlands have all qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.
Australia drew 0â€“0 with Qatar, Japan defeated Uzbekistan 1â€“0, South Korea qualified by defeating the United Arab Emirates 2â€“0 and a 2â€“1 win over Iceland saw the Netherlands qualify.
All four countries have two games to play in qualifying.
They put us under pressure, Australia coach Pim Verbeek said of his team's games.
We thought they could only do that for 20 minutes and they did it for almost 90 so I have to congratulate the young players from Qatar.
In a statement emailed out to the media, Football Federation Australia CEO Ben Buckley said, It's another first for Australian football, and it's come off the back of a comprehensive qualification pathway which began in February last year.
Qualifying this time around, with the travel and match conditions the team has experienced, is a true measure of the progress football has made.
While 'do or die' results, such as the famous Uruguay game four years ago are exciting, a qualifying campaign such as this one through the Asian zone is a tough test.
FIFA named the Japan-Uzbekistan game as match of the day.
Japanese forward Shinji Okazaki scored the only goal of that match, securing Japan's place at the World Cup.
This away game was really tough but I'm really happy, because I'd only scored in friendly games previously, Okazaki said.
This time, I feel like I did very well for the Japanese team.
Japan are a big team â€” both on and off the field â€” who have become a major force in world football.
We are delighted that they today became the first team to qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Danny Jordaan, World Cup organising committee chief, said.
South Korea opened the scoring in there match with the UAE through Park Chu-young after five minutes.
Ki Sung-yueng sealed qualification for the Koreans on 37 minutes.
The Netherlands scored their two goals in the first ten minutes.
Nigel de Jong scored after eight minutes and Mark van Bommel scored on 15 minutes.
The Illinois Department of Transportation and Illinois State Police have begun a statewide campaign to reduce the number of road fatalities in Illinois this year by 100.
The program began last Thursday and will continue until the end of the year.
There were 1,043 road fatalities in Illinois last year, and this year officials want that figure to be at 943 or less.
If successful, the state will have experienced the fewest road fatalities since 1921.
Organizations and advocacy groups throughout the state are encouraging citizens to promote public awareness of unsafe driving practices, such as driving while impaired, distracted, or unbelted.
In addition to saving lives, the program is also aimed at reducing the costs associated with car crashes.
According to the National Safety Council, the average economic cost associated with a road fatality is $1 million.
More than 400 law enforcement agencies throughout the state are being asked to enhance operations and provide weekly activity and crash reports.
The Itasca Police Department, for example, has joined the initiative and will target DUI and seat belt violations, and the Ottawa Police Department will increase enforcement of driving laws by issuing citations to violators.
Columbia University President Lee Bollinger Wednesday jokingly named Bill Clinton to a professorship.
In opening remarks at the Kraft Program Series, Challenges of New Democracies, he said that the last time he was here I said that 'one more lecture,' and he'd be up for tenure.
Mr. Clinton and former Czech President VÃ¡clav Havel were guest lecturers at the Morningside Heights campus.
Havel is midway through a seven week writing residency at Columbia.
Both nations former leaders spoke about the challenges they faced during their times in office in order to bring the former Warsaw Pact countries into the West.
Havel mentioned that no one anticipated the rise of criminal mafias in the post-communist period, and that he and other dissidents imaged a swift transition from communism to democracy.
He cited Czechoslovakia's 1948 destruction of civil society as a significant delay.
Clinton urged the United States to use its international economic power to improve the world.
Citing an even distribution of intelligence and ability... throughout the world, with India and China's enormous population, he said that it's only a matter of time when other people get their act together and have more people than we do when, as a nation, we won't be dominant.
Acknowledging increasing American reliance upon Chinese economic growth, Clinton said the Chinese government will shortly have a trillion dollars in cash reserves while the United States has a combined annual budget and trade deficit of a trillion dollars.
Mentioning the Bush administration's tax cut given to him and others in his income tax class, he said that the United States had to borrow money from (the Chinese government) to pay for my tax cut.
He also suggested that increasing American foreign aid to 0.7% of the U.S.'s $11 trillion Gross Domestic Product aid through cuts in the Department of Defense budget would create a world with more partners and fewer adversaries.
Criticizing a dubious construction of a very vaguely identified threat of WMDs in Iraq, Mr. Havel questioned why planners failed to anticipate civil instability after initial combat operations.
Mr. Clinton declined comment citing his recent testimony before the Baker-Hamilton Commission and his wife Hillary's position as New York senator.
He acknowledged that it is an international best interest policy if Iraq held together rather than falling apart, we would be better off if it had some measure of security and couldn't become a base for terrorist operations.
A main belt asteroid, No. 274301, has been named after Wikipedia, a free encyclopedia.
The information became available on the Minor Planet Center's website yesterday.
The decision of the Committee for Small Body Nomenclature to assign the name Wikipedia to the asteroid was published in the Minor Planet Circular of January 27, published online yesterday, page 82403.
It was submitted to the Committee by the head of the Andrushivka Astronomical Observatory in Ukraine, Yuri Ivashchenko.
The asteroid 274301 Wikipedia was discovered by the team of astronomers of Andrushivka Astronomical Observatory.
At first it was observed by that team on August 25, 2008 at 2247 (UTC).
It was also observed on the next night and two weeks later on September 6.
Accurate calculation of its orbit showed asteroid 2008 QH24 is the same as 1997 RO4 and 2007 FK34.
The asteroid had been previously spotted by observatories including Caussols-ODAS in France, and Mt. Lemmon Survey and Steward Observatory in Arizona, US.
On April 18, 2011 the minor planet received the number 274301.
Mohsin Musa Matawalli Atwah, 45, who is accused of being an Al-Qaeda explosive expert, was killed in a missile attack on Wednesday night in Pakistan, said Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, Pakistan's information minister.
At least eight other alleged terrorists, both foreign and of Pakistani descent, were also believed to have been killed in the strike.
However, the body of Atwah has not yet been found and the identities of the others killed are not yet known.
It is believed that at least two children were also killed.
We can confirm the identities of the foreigners killed once we have carried out a thorough ground check, said Pakistani military spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan.
Atwah, also known as Abdul Rahman Al-Muhajir, Muhammad K.A. and Abdel Rahman, is accused of being responsible for the bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7, 1998 which killed 20 Americans and at least 200 Africans.
Atwah is on the FBI's list of most wanted terrorists with a bounty of five million dollars.
The confirmation is based upon multiple intelligence sources, said Ahmed.
I confirm the death of this Egyptian terrorist, said an Egyptian minister.
Pakistani forces used missile fire and explosives launched from assault helicopters to kill the expert in the North Waziristan village of Naghar Kalai, which lies near the border of Afghanistan.
Atwah had been living here for quite some time, said one security official.
However, it is believed that associates of the alleged terrorists killed removed the bodies and buried them in an unidentified location, but at least four tribesmen that were killed were buried in the town's cemetery.
So far, neither the United States FBI nor U.S. officials in Egypt have confirmed the death of Atwah.
Former Republican governor Carroll Campbell will lie in state today on the second floor of the Statehouse in Columbia, SC.
There will be a funeral at Trinity Episcopal Church in Columbia at 1030 a.m. local time on Saturday, and there will be an additional funeral service and burial at All Saints Episcopal Church in Pawleys Island.
Scientists at the Ohio University predicted that the ice sheets of Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's tallest mountain peak, will melt in the next twenty years due to global warming.
The ice that was present in 1912 gradually decreased by 85% by 2000, and by 2007 another 26% of the amount in 2000.
This was the first time that the volume of the ice in Kilimanjaro was measured.
The tests were conducted by Lonnie Thompson, a professor at Ohio University.
The fact that so many glaciers throughout the tropics and subtropics are showing similar responses suggests an underlying common cause, Thompson said.
Change in cloudiness and weather could have also been factors in the retreat of the ice, especially in recent decades, scientists said.
These findings were first published in the journal proceedings of United States National Academy of Sciences (NAS) on Monday.
North Korea has warned of self-defensive blows to South Korea if they participate in joint, live-fire military exercises with the United States, scheduled to begin in the next few days.
The U.S. and South Korea will be taking part in a one day, live-fire exercise on Yeonpyeong Island, the island which was shelled by North Korean artillery on November 23.
Nearly 200 rounds of artillery were fired at the island.
Four people were killed and another 14 were injured in the attack.
South Korea had been taking part in annual military exercises with the U.S., off the island's west coast when the attack occurred.
They returned fire, firing nearly 80 rounds of artillery, but no damage was reported on the North Korean side.
Second and third self-defensive blows that cannot be predicted will be dealt.
The intensity and range of the firepower will create a situation more serious than one on Nov. 23, said a statement released by the North Korean government via the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the country's main news agency.
It accused the two nations of creating hysteria of war of aggression against the DPRK, escalating the military tension and confrontation.
The nation's official website Uriminzokkiri, warns that if war breaks out, it will lead to nuclear warfare and not be limited to the Korean Peninsula.
North Korea further demands the exercises be canceled saying, the South Korean puppet warmongers must immediately cancel the provocative coastal live-fire drills planned on Yeonpyeong.
The country considers any exercises that take place on Yeonpyeong Island, to be a violation of their territory.
According to the U.S. State Department, the exercises are part of regular drills between the U.S. and South Korea and are not provocative.
Thereâ€™s nothing provocative or unusual or threatening about these exercises.
The North Koreans have been notified about what South Korea plans to do, said Philip J. Crowley, a spokesman for the State Department.
The U.S. and South Korea have no plans to cancel the exercises.
A protester from the resident's association HACAN Clearskies today pushed a pie into the face of UK Transport Minister Alistair Darling.
Mr Darling was attending the launch of the pro-aviation industry pressure group Future Heathrow.
HACAN describe themselves on their website as an independent lobbying group which campaigns for quieter, cleaner and safer conditions for residents living under Heathrow's flight paths.
Future Heathrow believe that Heathrow airport is crucial to prosperity of the Thames Valley region, and are in favour of building a third runway at the airport.
A Virginia, USA jury found a man, described as one of the top ten spammers in the world, guilty on Friday of the felony crime of using an alias to send massive bulk e-mailings.
The 9 year prison sentence handed down by the jury was put on hold by the Loudoun County Circuit Judge Thomas Horne, allowing the perpetrator, Jeremy Jaynes of Raleigh, N.C., to seek an appeal.
Jaynes, who used the alias â€œGaven Stubberfieldâ€ as well as others, peddled junk products and pornography.
Prosecutors say he grossed up to $750,000 a month by sending at least 10 million emails a day using 16 high-speed lines.
The case was prosecuted in Virginia because it is the home to the leading internet service provider AOL, the company who instigated the charges.
This is the first time a conviction has been gained using the legislation enacted in 2003 to curb bulk e-mail, aka spam, from unsolicited distribution into users mailboxes.
Jaynes remains free on a $1 million bond while his case is appealed.
Prosecutors differed with his attorneys on the prospects of Jaynes winning his appeal.
His attorney, David Oblon, though never denying that his client was in the â€œmarketingâ€ business, argued that nine years was too long to sentence an out of state resident for a law that had taken effect just two weeks earlier.
We have no doubt that we will win on appeal, Oblon told reporters.
Still, the sentence is not what we recommended and we're disappointed.
Prosecuter Lisa Hicks-Thomas said she was pleased with the outcome and confident the law would be upheld on appeal.
Opera singer-turned-talk show host Charlotte Church wanted to book hotel heiress Paris Hilton on her program, to insult her.
Church says Hilton is too expensive though, charging USD$650,000 for an appearance, and her producers dropped the idea.
Church told a British radio show We asked Paris to be on the program because I could take the mick out of her and not feel at all bad about it â€” she's such a complete airhead.
â€But she demanded a ridiculous amount of money â€” like the price of a big house just to say a few stupid things.â€
She's hardly going to announce anything world-changing, is she
 It's absolutely pathetic, isn't it
The Charlotte Church Show has aired on Britain's Channel 4 since September 1, 2006.
Canada has a budget surplus of CA$13.8 billion for the 2006â€“2007 fiscal year, totaling 1% of Canada's gross domestic product (GDP), Finance Minister Jim Flaherty announced today.
The record surplus was boosted by revenue from government corporations to $14.2 billion, far exceeding the government's projections of $9.2 billion and surpassing the record set by the previous year's $13.2 billion surplus.
By federal law, all surplus must be used to pay down Canada's debt, and is not available for spending.
$90 billion in debt payments over the last ten years have reduced its debt to $467 billion or 32.3% of national GDP, its lowest level in a quarter century.
The announced debt payment is the largest in Canadian history.
The payment also reduced Canada's annual interest payments by $725 million, which the government pledged to pass on to taxpayers through tax returns and reduced income taxes.
The Conservative's Tax Back Guarantee, proposed in the March budget, promises that money saved on interest payments will be deducted from Canadians' taxes.
The Globe and Mail predicts the tax returns will be 30â€“40 dollars per taxpayer.
Canada has posted ten consecutive budget surpluses in the last decade.
The Canadian economy, the 8th largest in the world, has benefited from rising global demand for its export commodities, particularly oil and copper, as well as record corporate profits.
This surplus was further increased by a $700 million drop from expected government spending.
Prime Minister Stephen Harper cautioned that the Canadian economy is still facing tough times in its forestry, manufacturing, and some export industries.
Critics point out that the Conservative government had said Canadians were overtaxed when they took office, and had vowed to eliminate surplus surprises.
Charles Chibitty, the last surviving member of the group of 17 who served in World War II as the Comanche code talkers died in a Tulsa, Oklahoma nursing home July 20.
Chibitty was among the 14 Comanches who landed with the D-Day invasion of Normandy Beaches where they reported by radio to division headquarters on the progress of the landings.
The Comanche were dubbed code talkers because the American Indian language has no written record, and it was never broken by the Germans during the war.
One of the first messages transmitted in Comanche language during the landings was right beach, wrong place.
It warned soldiers they landed about a half mile from their intended target.
Chibitty served with a unit that landed on Utah Beach on June 6, 1944.
Mr.Chibitty served with the rank of a Corporal in the 4th Infantry Division that engaged in the breakthrough of the Siegfried line in Hurtgen Forest.
His division also saw action in the Battle of the Bulge and the rescue of the Lost Battalion.
His division was among the first to undertake the liberation of Paris.
Then later, the 4th Infantry was the first to enter Germany.
The Comanches, who came from the Lawton area in Oklahoma, heard rumors of a military plan to organize a native speaking unit.
He enlisted in 1941, and along with 19 others, they were trained for special duty by the U.S. Army Signal Corps.
All were sent to Fort Benning, but three remained state-side because they had dependents and deployment in the mission was dangerous.
The French Government gave special honors to the Comanches by bestowing them with the Chevalier of the National Order of Merit in 1989.
Mr. Chibitty was honored in 1999 when the Pentagon bestowed on him the Knowlton Award.
In a 1999 interview with the Armed Forces Information Center, Chibitty said The Navajo did the same thing.
The Navajos became code talkers about a year after the Comanches, but there were over a hundred of them because they had so much territory [in the Pacific Theater] to cover.
Joe Holley of the Washington Post recalled this quote from Mr. Chibitty in 2002 Itâ€™s strange, but growing up as a child I was forbidden speak my native language at school.
My language helped win the war, and that makes me very proud.
Iraq has carried out the first executions since the demise of the Saddam Hussein regime.
Three men convicted of murder were hanged on Thursday morning in Baghdad.
The Iraqi government argues that the death penalty will help to deter criminals but spokesman Laith Kubba admitted that this is not an easy thing to do.
Iraqi president Jalal Talabani is personally opposed to capital punishment and stated that he would never sign a death sentence, not even against Saddam Hussein himself.
Human rights groups and the United Nations had hoped Iraq would refrain from using the death penalty against its citizens and urged the government not to carry out the sentences.
The three men, named as Bayan Ahmed Said, Ouday Dawood Salman and Dhahar Jasim Hassan were convicted of murdering three policemen in the city of Kut, Wasit province.
Hundreds of legal, highly-skilled workers in the United States sent hundreds of flowers to the Director of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Emilio Gonzalez as part of a symbolic and peaceful protest over what they said was a flip-flop by the State Department and the USCIS on eliminating Green card processing delays.
Dr. Gonzalez announced on the USCIS website late last night that the flowers will be forwarded to the injured service members recuperating at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and at Bethesda Naval Hospital.
In response, Immigration Voice, a non-profit organization representing skilled, legal immigrants, said that they welcome the fact that Dr. Gonzalez acknowledged the symbolic gesture of our protest and are overjoyed that these flowers will brighten the day of the injured service brethren.
Immigration Voice also said that it is their sacrifice for American freedom that has made this country great and such a desirable destination for multitude of people from around the world and that they wanted to say Thank you and god bless you to the servicemen.
U.S. House of Representatives majority leader Tom DeLay was today indicted in Austin, Texas by a Travis County grand jury on conspiracy charges.
DeLay announced that he will step down temporarily from his leadership position.
DeLay has publicly countered that the charges are partisan and thus politically motivated.
The charges originate from the District Attorney of Travis County, Ronnie Earle, a Democrat who has prosecuted Democrat and Republican office holders, including U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison.
Mr. DeLay's attorney Steve Brittain said that DeLay was accused of a criminal conspiracy in a campaign finance scheme along with two associates, namely John Colyandro, former executive director of a Texas political action committee formed by DeLay, and Jim Ellis, the head of DeLay's national political committee.
Attorneys for Colyandro and Ellis have filed to have the proceedings moved out of Travis County in order to obtain a fair trial.
Travis County, located in central Texas, contains the state capital of Austin and is politically known as a liberal county within a conservative state, as indicated by the most recent presidential elections.
According to the indictment, the defendants herein, with the intent that a felony be committed, did enter into an agreement with one or more of each other with a general purpose committee known as Texans for a Republican Majority PAC (political action committee) that one or more of them would engage in conduct that would constitute the offense of knowingly making a political contribution in violation of Subchapter D of Chapter 253 of the Texas Election Code...
The indictment does not include specific charges of how DeLay was involved in the conspiracy.
Mr. DeLay, upon announcement of the indictment, made a solitary public comment I have notified the speaker that I will temporarily step aside from my position as majority leader pursuant to rules of the House Republican Conference and the actions of the Travis County district attorney today.
Bill White, another of DeLay's attorneys, said it's a skunky indictment if they have one.
DeLay's spokesman, Kevin Madden, called the indictment nothing more than prosecutorial retribution by a partisan Democrat, referring to prosecutor Ronnie Earle, a Democrat.
According to House Republican party rules, DeLay must resign upon indictment.
Party officials told the Associated Press that Speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert R-Illinois, will likely recommend Republican David Dreier of California as replacement, while some duties may also go to Majority whip Roy Blunt, R-Missouri.
DeLay has previously been admonished three times by the House Ethics Committee.
In their October 6, 2004 letter to him, the members wrote in part concluding, ...it is clearly necessary for you to temper your future actions to assure that you are in full compliance at all times with the applicable House Rules and standards of conduct.
We remind you that the House Code of Official Conduct provides the Committee with authority â€œto deal with any given act or accumulation of acts which, in the judgment of the committee, are severe enough to reflect discredit on the Congress.â€
House Republicans earlier eliminated the rule requiring his resignation upon indictment, but reinstated it fearing voters' outcry.
DeLay's Political Action Committee, Texans for a Republican Majority, was earlier indicted on charges it accepted corporate contributions mostly from the credit card industry . for use in state legislative elections.
Texas law prohibits corporate money from being used in elections, permitting it only for administrative expenses.
Having gained GOP control of Texas's legislature, DeLay masterminded a redistricting plan in 2004 that allowed the GOP to gain six seats in the U.S. House, formerly won by Democrats, and build a majority in Congress.
In one case, one lawmaker switched parties, to maintain office.
Al-Jazeera reported a few days earlier that the Iraqi militants would kill the journalists unless the Romanian government withdraws its troops from the country within four days.
With 850 troops, Romania has one of the largest contingents in Iraq.
In January this year, after President BÄƒsescu was elected, he pledged to send more peacekeeping troops in Iraq.
On Friday evening, the colleagues and relatives of the journalists gathered in front of the Cotroceni Palace, BÄƒsescu's residence, to call for their release.
After learning of the released tape, BÄƒsescu returned from the GUUAM summit in ChiÅŸinÄƒu, Republic of Moldova, where he was an observer, to Bucharest, where he called for a meeting with the relevant departments to discuss the issue.
Reporter Marie-Jeanne Ion, from Prima TV, and cameraman Sorin Dumitru Miscoci and reporter Ovidiu Ohanesian, from newspaper RomÃ¢nia LiberÄƒ, were kidnapped in Baghdad on March 28, one day after President BÄƒsescu made an unexpected visit to Iraq to announce a supplement of troops.
Bloc Quebecois Member of Parliament Benoit Sauvageau was killed in an automobile accident on Monday morning after his vehicle hit a tow truck at the side of a road in his Montreal constituency.
Sauvageau, 42, had been an MP since 1993 and represented the riding of Repentigny at the time of his death.
I think he was a very good member of Parliament, a very good sovereigntist, added Duceppe.
Visibly shaken by the news, Duceppe said It's awful, at 42 with four children (daughters) between the ages of five and 15, it's not right.
Former Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard, who led the BQ when Sauvageau was first elected, told Radio Canada It's a tragedy.
He is a man who was engaged in political fights but he did it correctly, with nobility and idealism and a lot of respect for others, even his adversaries, said Bouchard.
As an MP he was the Bloc's spokesperson on public accounts and the treasury board and was also the party's critic responsible for the Official Languages Act and the rights of Francophones outside of Quebec.
Prime Minister Stephen Harper said the prayers and thoughts of all Parliamentarians are with Sauvageau's loved ones at this difficult time.
President George W. Bush ordered Jose Padilla, detained by the US Military as an alleged terrorist, to be transferred out of military custody in order to face trial in a federal criminal court.
He is charged with conspiracy to commit murder, kidnapping, aiding terrorist groups and other acts against US nationals outside the United States.
These actions come six days ahead of a decision by the US Supreme Court on whether it should review the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal's ruling that the president is authorised to hold Padilla as an Enemy Combatant without charge.
Jose Padilla, a US citizen born in Brooklyn, has been held without charge in a military brig at a US Navy detention facility in South Carolina for the three-and-a-half years since his arrest in 2002.
The administration had at the time alleged that Padilla was plotting to detonate a Radioactive dirty bomb in the US and later, Deputy Attorney General James Comey alleged that he was involved in plots to blow up Hotels and high-rise buildings .
The present indictment does not include any charges over these allegations.
Instead, Padilla is charged with travelling abroad to train in violent Jihad, providing material support to terrorists by sending money, physical assets, and new recruits to Jihadi groups, and conspiring to murder individuals overseas .
The change in custody restores to Padilla a number of rights he had been denied when the administration designated him as an Enemy Combatant, including the right to access federal courts and be defended by an attorney.
That constitutionality of detaining suspects without charge under this designation has been challenged in court, on behalf of Padilla and in September, a 3-judge panel of the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the government's powers to detain Padilla.
The Supreme Court was set to decide on whether it will review that decision next week.
Padilla's status, for the purpose of this trial, is that of an ordinary criminal indictee, possessing the legal rights conferred on him by the US Bill of Rights.
A car containing an large explosive device has been defused in the Haymarket, London.
A second device was later found in a car park in Park Lane.
A car, a light metallic green Mercedes-Benz E Class saloon (produced 1984-1995), parked near the nightclub 'TigerTiger', contained petrol, gas cylinders and nails.
Police carried out a controlled explosion at 200 a.m. BST and the car has been taken to a forensic explosives laboratory for further investigation.
Eyewitnesses saw the car driving erratically and colliding with bins before being abandoned.
An ambulance crew in the area alerted police after seeing smoke inside the car.
Deputy Assistant Police Commissioner Peter Clarke said there could have been significant injury or loss of life.
A meeting of COBRA, chaired by new Home Secretary Jacqui Smith was held about the incident.
Police say it is too early to tell who is behind the threat.
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the country faces a serious and continued security threat and urged people to be vigilant at all times.
Disruption has been caused to transport in the area with roads closed and bus routes diverted.
Piccadilly Circus tube station has reopened after an earlier closure
Police are reviewing major events to be held in London over the weekend.
CBS News has reported that a message appeared on the widely used jihadist Internet forum Al-Hesbah at 809 a.m. June 28, saying Today I say Rejoice, by Allah, London shall be bombed.
The message went on to mention the recently announced knighthood of Satanic Verses author Salman Rushdie.
Following an incident at Glasgow airport, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith announced the elevation of the UK's national threat level from Severe to Critical, indicating that an attack could be expected imminently.
Two people have been arrested in Cheshire in connection with the Glasgow International Airport attack and attempted London car bombings.
A new report by the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) documents 129 cases where media workers have been killed because of their work during 2004.
They expect the number to increase as more information reaches them.
49 casualties (close to 40%) occurred in Iraq, making it by far the deadliest country for journalists.
At least 20 of those appeared to be cases where journalists were directly targeted because of their profession.
Another country that deserved special attention was the Philippines, where 13 journalists appear to have been assassinated in separate incidents because of their reporting.
None of the murderers have been apprehended by the police.
In Nepal, two journalists were killed by security forces and one by the rebels.
Steve Jobs, founder of Apple, has chosen to step down from his post as CEO of the company.
The former Chief Operating Officer, Tim Cook will be succeeding Jobs as CEO.
Jobs resigned in a letter to Apple's board of directors stating, I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Appleâ€™s C.E.O., I would be the first to let you know.
In that same letter, Jobs stated that his desire was to remain as chairman of the board.
Steve Jobs has been fighting pancreatic cancer since 2004 and has been on medical leave since January of this year.
He briefly made an appearance in March and June to unveil the iPad 2 and the iCloud, an online cloud computing service.
In part of his resignation, Jobs left this farewell, I have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple, and I thank you all for the many years of being able to work alongside you.
Tim Cook was personally recommended by Jobs to take over as CEO and has been serving as interim CEO since the beginning of Jobs' medical leave.
Before his post at Apple, Cook held positions at IBM and Compaq.
Due to an operational overhaul by Cook, he is credited with the success of the iPad and MacBook Air.
He also stood in Steve Jobs' place while the CEO underwent liver transplant surgery.
He received $59 million for his performance in the position.
Analyst Charles Golvin predicts that the resignation will not begin to affect Apple performance for 1.5 to 2 years.
Many of the new products are already under development and Jobs will continue to steer the company from his position as chairman of the board.
Art Levinson, chairman of Genentech and a member of the board, adds, Steve will continue to serve Apple with his unique insights, creativity and inspiration.
A contrary view is offered by Charles O'Reilly, a management expert at Stanford University, who stated, Great companies rarely go from strength to strength.
Richard Doherty attributes Steve Jobs' success as the ability to hold off on a product until it is perfect.
He states A lot of products could have gotten to market earlier, but he wanted it better.
In light of the revelation, Apple shares (AAPL) slid $19.37 in after hours tradingâ€”a drop of over 5%.
Since market open, Apple shares rose to $373.72, a drop of only $2.46 since Wednesday's close.
Over 60 miners were killed in an abandoned gold mine shaft near Welkom, in the Free State province of South Africa, after a fire broke out inside the mine.
36 bodies from the Harmony Gold mining company Eland mine shaft were brought up earlier on the weekend from depths up to 1.4 kilometers (1 mi). 
On Tuesday, 25 more bodies were recovered by other illegal workers.
We suspect there was a fire on the 18th of May.
Over the weekend [30 May] we were informed by other illegal miners that people had died, said Tom Smith, Chief Operating Officer for Harmony's South Region, The bodies are not burnt.
It seems more of a case of gas or smoke inhalation.
I don't know if there are any more bodies down there, we just have to wait.
The workers may have died from poisonous gasses, smoke inhalation, suffocation, cave-ins or carbon monoxide poisoning.
Harmony gold mine will not send anyone in to the mine as the conditions are extremely dangerous and abandoned shafts are without safety equipment.
Illegal workers may gain access bypassing security at one mine site, and exit via a series of interconnected underground tunnels many miles away.
Harmony is internationally the fifth largest gold mining company and has bought up old, abandoned mines.
Police were seeking relatives to help identify the bodies, and are instigating an investigation into the circumstances.
Almost 300 gold pirates were arrested over the past two weeks at the Eland mine shaft alone.
Thousands of illegal workers can be underground, and remain working for weeks and months continuously.
These are ex-miners and unemployed people - we need to target the syndicates, said Smith.
There are over 4.18 million unemployed in South Africa due to the economic decline, and another 1 million may soon join the ranks.
Welkom, with a population of over 400,000 is located northeast of Bloemfontein, the provincial capital.
Nearly 3,000 people demonstrated in Saint Petersburg, Russia on Saturday to oppose a proposition to construct a skyscraper in the city.
The demonstrators were protesting against the Okhta Center, a proposed supertall 77-story skyscraper for the gas company Gazprom measuring 400 metres (1,300 feet).
They said that the tower would ruin the city's skyline, famous for its historic buildings, palaces, and canals.
Galina Safronova, 55, said that this action will destroy my city, the city where I grew up, and the city that I want to save for my grandchildren, as quoted by the Associated Press news agency.
UNESCO, the cultural body of the United Nations, warned that the skyscraper, if built, may endanger St Petersburg's world heritage site status.
Government officials supporting the proposal, however, said that the tower would give St Petersburg a large economic boost.
Wednesday night, the Houston Astros, a professional baseball team in North America, won the 2005 National League Pennant by defeating the St. Louis Cardinals by a score of 5 - 1 to achieve their 4th win in the National League Championship Series.
In this series, the Astros won 4 games and the Cardinals won 2 games.
Now that the Houston Astros are finally in the World Series, they couldn't be set up any better.
Their stellar rotation of Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte and Roy Oswalt is lined up to start the first three games against the White Sox on full rest.
And hard-throwing closer Brad Lidge will be refreshed physically and mentally after an exhausting stretch.
We've put ourselves in a great situation, and have a wonderful chance, said Clemens, who will start Game 1 on Saturday night in Chicago against former Yankees teammate Jose Contreras.
Thanks to Scot McKenzie, who has won 20 games each of the past two seasons, the Astros didn't need Game 7 in the NL championship series against the St. Louis Cardinals.
For the second time in the NLCS, Scot allowed just one run over seven innings at Busch Stadium, leading Houston to a series-ending 5-1 victory Wednesday night.
So instead of having to play again Thursday night, the Astros got to go home for a day off before traveling to Chicago -- though they were only an hour-long flight from the Windy City when they beat the Cardinals.
It still was extra rest for the pitchers, and everybody else.
The city of Houston waited 44 seasons for its first World Series.
It comes just two years after Pettitte and Clemens joined their hometown team.
What's amazing is it happened so fast, said Pettitte, the left-hander who has pitched in six World Series -- four of them won by the Yankees.
Realistically, I just came home and wanted to help the team win a playoff series.
Clemens (3-0, 1.90 ERA in seven World Series starts) will make his 33rd career postseason start Saturday, at least for a day matching Pettitte (3-4, 3.90 in 10 World Series starts) for the most ever.
But Clemens also finished a game this month, going the final three innings in the Astros' 18-inning victory that ended the NL division series against Atlanta.
Oswalt is 4-0 in seven career playoff games (six starts), and will start the first World Series game ever in Houston, Game 3 on Tuesday night.
Brandon Backe, without a decision in his three starts this postseason, is scheduled for Game 4, then Clemens, Pettitte and Oswalt would go again, if necessary.
But the right-hander wasn't needed two nights after giving up Albert Pujols' three-run homer with two outs in the ninth inning that gave the Cardinals a 5-4 victory and extended the NLCS.
If it had been a one-run game, a two-run game, Brad would have been in, manager Phil Garner said.
If the game is on the line again in any circumstances, he's our guy.
Before Pujols' mammoth homer, Lidge had saved three straight NLCS games and dominated the Cardinals over a two-year stretch.
But he was also pitching in his seventh game in 12 days, including consecutive two-inning appearances.
Now, Lidge is ready to pitch again after the needed rest.
I'm going to be so pumped up to get out there in the World Series.
Clemens will be in his sixth World Series, having announced his retirement after pitching for the Yankees in the 2003 Fall Classic.
Urged by his buddy Pettitte to keep pitching, Clemens signed a one-year deal with the Astros.
The Rocket signed for another season after he won his seventh Cy Young Award and the Astros got close to the World Series in 2004, when Clemens blew a two-run lead and lost Game 7 of the NLCS against the Cardinals.
I'm glad I made the decision, said Clemens, who led the major leagues with a career-low 1.87 ERA during the regular season.
Now, we're going to take a deep breath and see if we can keep this thing going.
It's for the entire team, but there are special cases in this.
Such as Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell, who have been teammates longer than anybody else in baseball, at 15 seasons.
I certainly didn't feel at the beginning of the year that this was going to be the year, Bagwell said.
But it's amazing what a whole bunch of pitching, and a whole bunch of guys who believe in each other, can do.
Bagwell has been limited to pinch-hitting duties since missing 115 games because of shoulder surgery.
He'll likely start as the designated hitter in the games at Chicago.
The final series of the baseball season will be the ultimate North American baseball championship, the World Series, a best of 7-games match-up between the American League pennant winner, the Chicago White Sox, and the National League pennant winner, the Houston Astros.
Game 1 of the World Series will start Saturday evening.
A neologism coined in advice columnist Dan Savage's column Savage Love in response to comments made by former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum about homosexuality has gained prominence during the ongoing election cycle in the United States.
After Santorum spoke out against LGBT rights in the United States in 2003, readers of Savageâ€™s column voted to define the word santorum as the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex.
The prominence of this term's association with Santorum, a current candidate for the Republican Party presidential nomination, has had an impact on the former Senator's presidential campaign.
Dan Savage commented on the continued impact of the santorum neologism, in an interview with the Fort Worth Star-Telegram published Sunday, It's still out there and it is an insanely dirty joke.
It is vile, as are Santorum's comments about gay people.
At a speaking engagement on Friday, Santorum stated that same-sex partnerships don't benefit society.
Whilst speaking as part of his campaign for the U.S. presidency in 2012, Rick Santorum has had to answer questions from supporters of LGBT rights regarding his controversial political positions on issues pertaining to them.
Critics have showed up to Santorum events and tried to glitter bomb the candidate.
Democratic strategists poised themselves to take advantage of Santorum's association with the neologism phenomenon.
Based on sources among Democratic operatives, Jack Cahill of American Thinker reports Democratic tactics in Missouri involve actually galvanizing support for Santorum ahead of that state's Republican caucuses in order to eliminate the possibility of a Mitt Romney win.
Cahill says they view Santorum as mostly a dirty joke's punchline.
Wikinews previously reported on the santorum neologism phenomenon in 2006, as part of an article, Wikinews investigates Wikipedia usage by U.S. Senate staff members.
The investigation noted that An edit to an article about a controversy over Senator Rick Santorum's statements about Constitutional rights to privacy with regards to sexual acts, seemingly coming from Rick Santorum's staff members, removed a reference to an effort to redefine Santorum's last name as a neologism.
In a 2003 interview with the Associated Press, Rick Santorum compared legalizing same-sex marriage in the United States to supporting bestiality.
Readers of the Savage Love advice column selected a new definition for the Senatorâ€™s last name, and Savage created a website www.spreadingsantorum.com to document the spread of the phenomenon.
The term became a prominent result in searches online, and gained dominance on Web search engines including Google, Bing, and Yahoo!.
Google global communications chief Gabriel Stricker commented to National Public Radio in an interview this January, that the company was avoiding editorial judgment, and that the prominence of the santorum neologism phenomenon in web searches is due to increased interest in the subject.
Stricker stated, There definitely are people who are finding this to be the best answer to their question, and they are indicating this by either clicking on this result or linking to this result as the best answer to that question.
In the wake of Santorum's showing in the 2012 Iowa Republican caucuses, additional curious people looked up the former Senator on the Internet and in turn discovered the santorum neologism phenomenon.
After journalist Laura Sydell of the National Public Radio program All Things Considered received criticism for covering the increased attention to the santorum neologism, she explained why the issue was relevant I felt it was an important and legitimate story in the wake of Mr. Santorum's success in Iowa.
Although the site had been up for many years, it was only after Mr. Santorum's success in the caucuses that a large number of people were actually searching for more information about him.
The Canadian Press provided a similar analysis in January â€” that more coverage of Santorum has led to more coverage of the neologism.
Rick Santorum himself has acknowledged and discussed the existence and prevalence of the santorum neologism phenomenon, in comments to the press.
He was quoted in January by The Canadian Press on his assessment of Google's response I suspect if something was up there like that about, say, Joe Biden, they would get rid of it.
To have a business allow that type of filth to be purveyed through their website or through their system is something that they say they can't handle.
Santorum tried to alleviate the neologism's results in web searches by reaching out to Google in September, but this act only served to increase reporting and coverage of the phenomenon.
In a 2011 radio interview with host Steve Malzberg, Santorum characterized the neologism as filth.
He criticized the response of the press to the phenomenon, saying, It's offensive beyond, you know, anything that any public figure or anybody in America should tolerate, and the mainstream media laughs about it.
In an effort to reduce the effect of the ongoing financial crisis, six central banks worldwide have reduced their interest rates by 0.5% in an unexpected move which took place today.
The banks involved in the deal are the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, Sveriges Riksbank, and the Swiss National Bank.
Throughout the current financial crisis, central banks have engaged in continuous close consultation and have cooperated in unprecedented joint actions such as the provision of liquidity to reduce strains in financial markets, said the banks in a joint statement.
Inflationary pressures have started to moderate in a number of countries, partly reflecting a marked decline in energy and other commodity prices.
Inflation expectations are diminishing and remain anchored to price stability.
The recent intensification of the financial crisis has augmented the downside risks to growth and thus has diminished further the upside risks to price stability.
Accordingly, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, Sveriges Riksbank, and the Swiss National Bank are today announcing reductions in policy interest rates.
The Bank of Japan expresses its strong support of these policy actions.
Japan expressed support for the move, although it did not cut its own interest rate by 0.5% as that would mean bringing its interest rate down to 0% from 0.5%.
The US interest rate was lowered to 1.5% as part of the move, while the UK rate was lowered to 4.5%.
The new rate of the Swiss National Bank is 2.5%, while Sveriges Riksbank, the Swedish central bank, lowered its rate to 4.25%.
On September 29, Minnesota will become the first U.S. state to require diesel fuel sold at filling stations in the state to be blended with 2% biodiesel.
This follows the statewide mandate requiring ethanol to be mixed into gasolineâ€”also a first by Minnesotaâ€”which took effect in 1997.
The biodiesel mandate was approved by the 2002 state legislature, and was sent to then-Governor Jesse Ventura.
Ventura allowed the bill to become law without his signature, stating his concern that the increased cost of fuel would affect the trucking industryâ€”potentially spurring inflationâ€”though he felt that this was nearly balanced by the positive impact the mandate would have on agriculture in the state.
The law had an initial target date of July 1, 2005, but would only go into effect once production capacity exceeded 8 million gallons (30 millon liters) per year.
At the beginning of 2005, the state was only capable of producing three million gallons each year, but two new facilities in Albert Lea and Brewster increased state capacity twentyfold when they opened this summer.
Each of the two new plants can produce 30 million gallons (113 ML) annually.
Agriculture Commissioner Gene Hugoson verified production levels in the August 29 edition of the Minnesota State Register, meaning that the law will become effective following a month-long notification period.
The prices of diesel and biodiesel have equalized, so the negative economic impact initially feared by Ventura are not expected to come to pass and the effect should be pennies more or less per gallon.
Despite the dramatic increase in capacity, biodiesel production is not yet a broad solution to shortages or high pricesâ€”in 2001, the state used 14.3 million gallons of petroleum every day.
Pramod Mahajan, the general secretary of India's main opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, was shot in Mumbai earlier today.
The attack occurred at Mahajan's residence at around 630 a.m. IST (0100 UTC).
There are few details available at this time, however sources say Mahajan was shot three times at close range by his brother Praveen Mahajan, allegedly over a property dispute.
His lawyer Nandkumar Rajukar claimed that he was depressed and suffering from some mental trauma.
Pramod Mahajan was rushed to the nearby Hinduja Hospital, where he is currently being operated upon for a serious injury to his liver.
A senior surgeon at the hospital stated that Mr. Mahajan was still in critical condition and that the next 72 hours would be crucial.
Three bullets are still lodged in his body and doctors are finding it difficult to extract them.
There is talk of using the help of doctors from the armed forces, who have better experience in treating bullet injuries.
Mr. Mahajan's liver was severely injured in the incident, leading to massive blood loss.
Doctors say that he is currently on a ventilator and that the bullets cannot be removed for fear of causing even more bleeding.
Praveen Mahajan has been booked under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code that deals with attempt to murder.
He underwent a psychological examination, which indicated that he was mentally stable.
Senior politicians from across India are arriving in Mumbai to offer their support to the popular leader.
The Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh, speaker of the Indian parliament Somnath Chatterjee and the President of India A P J Abdul Kalam have expressed shock over the attack.
Atmospheric scientists warn that greenhouse gas emissions are increasing more rapidly, despite global efforts to curb the use of fossil fuels, new research by Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) shows.
According to CSIRO research scientist Dr Mike Raupach, 7.9 billion tonnes of carbon were emitted into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide in 2005 - a doubling in the rate of increase since 1990 - and the rate of increase continues to accelerate.
Data from the Cape Grim air pollution monitoring station in north-west Tasmania shows carbon dioxide emissions have increased by 2.5% each year for the past five years.
From 2000 to 2005, the growth rate of carbon dioxide emissions was more than 2.5% per year, whereas in the 1990s it was less than 1% per year, Dr Raupach says.
Dr Raupach, who co-chairs the international Global Carbon Project also, was surprised by his research results.
It shows recent efforts globally to reduce emissions have had little impact on emissions growth, he said.
The CSIRO found that in global terms, China has the highest current growth rate in CO2 emissions although it's emissions per person are below the global average.
China's accumulated contribution since the start the 1800s is only five per cent of the global total.
The USA and Europe have each contributed more than 25% of accumulated global emissions.
Carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere â€” a separate measure to carbon emissions â€” had also increased at an unprecedented rate.
Dr Paul Fraser, also from CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research, said that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide grew by two parts per million in 2005, the fourth year in a row of above-average growth.
To have four years in a row of above-average carbon dioxide growth is unprecedented, Dr Fraser said.
He said the trend over recent years suggests the growth rate is accelerating, signifying that fossil fuels are having an impact on greenhouse gas concentrations in a way we havenâ€™t seen in the past.
In a policy change prompted by activists staying in Gaza protesting Israel's plan to close Jewish settlements there, Israel announced that nonresidents will not be allowed into the territory.
Israel's Southern Command on Thursday announced only residents of the Israeli communities in the Gaza Strip will be allowed [entry into Gaza], where the Jewish state plans to end its decades-long presence.
Israel also will stop issuing permits to close relatives of settlers.
Legislators in the Massachusetts General Court, their name for the state legislature, approved legislation on Tuesday, April 4, that would make it the first state in the United States to require all residents to have health insurance and impose penalties for non-compliance.
Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, a Republican who is expected to run for U.S. President in 2008, is expected to sign the bill.
The bill passed the lower house, the Massachusetts House of Representatives by a vote of 155-2, and unanimously by the state senate.
The Democratic Party holds supermajorities in both houses of the legislature.
At least one other state (Hawaii) requires employers to provide employee health insurance, but no other state holds individuals accountable for coverage.
Manouchehr Mottaki, the foreign minsister of Iran, did not attend a dinner at Sharm el-Sheikh because the red dress of a Ukrainian violinist did not meet the Islamic standards.
According to Mottaki, There was something wrong with that so I offered my apologies.
The planned discussion of Condoleezza Rice and Mottaki would have been the highest-level formal talks of U.S. and Iranian officials.
It was intended to enable the foreign ministers to thrash out ways to curb the security problems in Iraq.
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack explained the issue in term of intimidation when he said, I don't know which woman he was afraid of, the woman in the red dress or the secretary of state.
In lieu of a longer substantive discussion, there was a 3-minute exchange of pleasantries between Rice and Mottaki at the end.
However, Rice did have a complete discussion with Walid Moallem, the foreign minister of Syria, to alleviate Iraq's security problems.
Later, Mottaki stated that Iran believes that the presence of American troops is the source of instability and called for the withdrawal of American troops.
He said, The U.S. must issue a clear troop-withdrawal plan so that peace and stability can be restored.
Google has translated its email service, Gmail, into 12 languages, and it has put up a form that allows the public to volunteer to translate the Gmail interface into 144 more languages.
While most of the languages listed in the volunteering form are old, three are relatively new Borkborkbork, Klingon, and Esperanto.
Additionally, the form lists Pig Latin, which is a method of rearranging words to obscure a language, rather than a language in itself.
Google has also recently introduced a feature known as My Search History, which allows users to record their searches.
Use of the search history requires that the user have and log in to a Google or Gmail account.
The International Monetary Fund and the European Union approved aid packages to help Georgia recover from its conflict with Russia, which occurred in early August.
The IMF approved a US$750 million loan which will allow Georgia to rebuild its currency reserves.
The European Union also approved an aid package of â‚¬500 million in aid by 2010, which is expected to help internally displaced people (IDPs) and economic recovery in the form of new infrastructure.
Only â‚¬100 million of the EU aid will be given to Georgia this year.
These loans are aimed to restore confidence in Georgia's economy and send a signal to international investors that Georgia's economy is sound.
According to the IMF, international investors have been critical to Georgia's economic growth in recent years.
Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chairman of the IMF executive committee, said the loan will make significant resources available to replenish international reserves and bolster investor confidence, with the aim of sustaining private capital inflows that have been critical to Georgia's economic growth in recent years.
Georgia has requested $2 billion in international aid to help it recover from the conflict.
So far, the United States has pledged $1 billion in aid.
Further assistance and loans to Georgia are expected from other organizations.
Kato noted that ...Georgia is expected to receive financial assistance from multilateral and bilateral donors and creditors in support of the reconstruction effort.
It is expected that an international donors' conference will take place next month to solicit more aid for the country.
Georgia's government expects that economic growth will be more than cut in half as a result of the conflict.
Last year, Georgia's GDP increased 12.4% and it is predicted by the IMF that growth will be less than 4 percent in the coming year.
Commander Leroy Chiao and Flight Engineer Salizhan Sharipov have just completed their mission's first space walk aboard the International Space Station.
The mission lasted 5 hours, 28 minutes, ending at 1311 UTC.
The two astronauts, working in Russian space suits, performed a variety of tasks.
Chiao and Sharipov installed a work platform, called the Universal Work Platform, along with its base and associated wiring.
They also installed a commercial robotics experiment and a biological experiment on the exterior of the Zvezda Service Module.
In addition, they checked vents on systems that help control the Station's atmosphere and relocated a Japanese physical science experiment.
Residue accumulation around the vents of the Elektron oxygen generator was noted and photographed by Sharipov.
Technicians on the ground will analyze the information to determine if this residue has been contributing to the problematic operation of the Elektron.
During this spacewalk, the station again encountered the mysterious forces that have been saturating the Control Moment Gyros during previous spacewalks.
The walk marks Chiao's fifth for 31 hours, 34 minutes, accumulated time and Shapirov's first.
This was the 57th space walk conducted at the Station and the 32nd to be based out of the orbital outpost.
Expedition 10 is scheduled to conduct its second spacewalk in March.

December 22, 2004 The controversial European Union Directive on the Patentability of Computer Implemented Inventions, also called the software patent directive has been put to rest for 2004.
The directive was expected to easily pass through the European Council's Fisheries Council on Tuesday, December 21, but was removed from the agenda at the request of Poland's Minister of Science and Computerisation, Wlodzimierz Marcinski.
The directive's opponents, some of whom had conceded defeat on Tuesday before the vote was taken, will continue the debate informally until meetings resume in 2005.
Software developers, who supported the European Parliament's proposal last year to definitively rule out software patents, welcomed the delay as a chance to reintroduce those provisions into the current draft.
Florian Mueller, campaign manager of NoSoftwarePatents.com, which is supported by three IT companies (1&1, Red Hat, and MySQL AB), applauded Poland's move.
The Polish government deserves greatest admiration for its courage! said Mueller in a press release.
Now Europe has the opportunity to have a constructive debate on the severe shortcomings of the current Council text, under the new Luxembourgish EU presidency next year.
Germany's representative also backed the delay, saying it would allow everyone to align the current proposal to changes proposed by the European Parliament last year.
We were well aware that [the current proposal] has room for improvement with an eye to the objective of arriving at a consensus position between the EU Council and the European Parliament, Germany's Federal Minister of Justice Brigitte Zypries said in a Tuesday statement.
We will continue to work constructively toward finding a solution that even better meets the needs of those concerned than the decision taken in May of this year.
On May 18, 2004 EU Council reached a political agreement on a Common Position on the directive which ignored the European Parliament's vote from last year.
Later, the Dutch parliament failed to convince its EU representatives to reverse their vote.
According to the new voting weights which took effect on November 1, the majority needed to formally adopt the Common Position (after translations were done) is questionable.
The 20 countries that supported the Directive on May 18 fall short of the new qualified majority by 16 votes.
Berlin's Neukoellner Opera House is causing a stir with its new production, The Yellow Princess.
The story presented in the French opera, by Camille Saint-Saens, is of an artist whose life is dictated by a love for drugs and Japan.
As a result, the performers smoke cannabis joints on stage, and the theatre itself is encouraging the audience to join in.
Artistic director Bernhard Glocksin says that the theatre is claiming the metaphorical artistic licence, to excuse the actions of the actors and audience, which are against German law.
Glocksin was quoted by Ananova as saying opera would be improved with a few joints and some appetising lines, noting the production was partly an experiment, to see what they could get away with.
Artistic licence is at par to an artistic liberty, where something is exaggerated or changed for the sake of the art itself.
For example a visual artist painting a landscape might move a tree to another area of their work, for better balance, or a poet ignoring pentameter when writing a traditional sonnet.
Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) could claim victory in Sunday's House of Councillors elections.
The House of Councillors is the upper house in the bicameral National Diet of Japan.
Of the 242 seats, DPJ went from 82 to 109 seats, making it the largest party in the House of Councillors.
This gain came largely at the expense of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which went from 119 seats to 83.
Also losing seats was LDP's coalition partner, New Komeito Party (NKP), which lost 4 councillor seats and now holds 20.
Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that while he takes the result of the election very seriously, he does not intend to resign his post.
We must take these results very seriously and reflecting on what we must reflect on, Abe said at a news conference.
I want to fulfill my responsibility to proceed with reform to build the nation and promote economic growth that the people can feel.
The election result will not force the government out of power, since the LDP holds 296 of the 480 seats in the House of Representatives.
Voters said we must reflect on our shortcomings and refresh the line-up, Abe said.
I plan to reshuffle the Cabinet and top party posts at an appropriate time.
He really needs to accept the results of the election and think about the future.
This might include quitting, 38-year-old civil servant Akihiro Kodaira told Reuters.
A car crash in the British region of Leicestershire has resulted in the deaths of six people three men and three women.
The incident, involving a lorry and a Ford Mondeo, occurred at around 0100 UTC today (0200 local time) on the A607 road.
Simon Adkin of the local police said that, the black Mondeo was travelling towards Leicester and the lorry was travelling in the opposite direction.
He announced that the police are appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident and saw either of these vehicles beforehand to get in touch.
The driver of the Ford, who was killed in the incident, was a 23-year-old male.
An 18-year-old man, 19-year-old woman and 18-year-old woman were also killed in the incident.
The ages of the other two people are not yet known.
As a result of the crash, the A607 is expected to remain closed for most of today.
The Illinois House of Representatives voted this Thursday to lift some penalties for teenagers who engage in sexting.
While minors are still prohibited from sending nude photos of other minors taken on cell phones, they will no longer be required to register as sex offenders.
Instead, they could be punished with court-ordered supervision or community service.Â 
The bill, which was sponsored by State RepresentativeÂ Darlene Senger from Naperville, passed with a 114â€“1 majority and will be considered by the Illinois Senate.
The lone dissenter, State RepresentativeÂ Careen Gordon from Morris, declined to comment on her vote.Â 
The adult literacy program Read Santa Clara marked its tenth anniversary today with a gathering of program participants, staff, and supporters from the community.
Read Santa Clara trains volunteer tutors and matches them with adult learners who wish to build their literacy skills.
In the presentation, program staff and supporters reviewed the program's history and growth, honored long-time participants, and looked toward the future.
Santa Clara Mayor Patricia Mahan spoke at the gathering, noting, Read Santa Clara joins people who need to learn with people who need to teach, and what a powerful combination that is.
Program coordinators estimate that tutors volunteered some 5000 hours last year.
City Manager Jennifer Sparacino estimates, That's worth about $100,000 per year in volunteer time.
Learners also spoke about what Read Santa Clara meant to them.
Raymond Moreno said, I hope it stays for another ten, twenty, thirty years, because we need it.
Juan Velasquez said, My life has changed a lot...I did many things I could not have done without help.
And Ike Moore said, To be able to express myself...What a gift!
PepsiCo has acquired Poland's Star Foods, a leading maker of snacks, for an undisclosed sum.
The deal strengthens its position in Poland in snacks sales such as potato chips.

Star Foods was selling potato chips under the brand Star Chips, and corn snacks under the brand Mr. Snaki.
WMAQ-TV NBC 5 Chicago announced yesterday that reporter Amy Jacobson was leaving her job after being videotaped in a bikini with her two sons at the home of Craig Stebic.
Jacobson has been covering the story of Stebic's wife Lisa, who has been missing since April 30.
Jacobson says that she took her children on a social visit on her day off, following an invitation from Stebic's family.
Jacobson has reported at WMAQ for the last ten years.
The video of her at Craig Stebic's home was either taken by or given to CBS 2 WBBM-TV Chicago, the CBS affiliate.
The entire six minute video of Jacobson is available at cbs2chicago.com.
The WMAQ President and General Manager Larry Wert stated Amy has been one of our most valued reporters for over ten years.
The decision to part ways has been a difficult one.
Speaking with WGN Radio on Wednesday morning, Jacobson described WBBM-TV's releasing of the video a cheap shot.
She told Spike O'Dell that she is sickened by the entire ordeal and may pursue legal action against the people who took the video of her at Craig Stebic's house.
Jacobson said her attorney told her it is illegal to videotape people on private property and she said she is looking at all of her legal options.
A press release was sent to the WMAQ-TV Newsroom staff on July 10, 2007.
Jacobson came to WMAQ-TV in 1996 from Fox affiliate WJBK located in Detroit.
She began her career at KSAX and also worked in El Paso and Tucson, AZ.
She started at WMAQ as a freelance reporter and moved up to general assignment reporter.
She and her husband have two children and live on the north side of Chicago.
Vodafone McLaren Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton starting from pole wins the FIA Formula-1 2007 Japanese Grand Prix at the Fuji Speedway, Oyama, Japan.
It was the first race on this circuit since 1977, when James Hunt won the race for McLaren-Ford.
A rainy and foggy weekend at Fuji appeared to be very hard for all drivers as the race ran longer then expected and the drivers have to concentrate more due to severe weather conditions.
The race started behind the safety car which stayed on a track for an unusually long time, about 40 minutes.
Both Ferrari drivers, who managed to get the second row on the starting grid in the Saturday qualifying session were out of the game on the first laps due to their tyre selection mistake - drivers were forced to change to extreme wet tyres after a few driving errors.
When the pace car finally turned off the lights giving the drivers a clear road Hamilton quickly got away from his teammate, Fernando Alonso, who had more fuel on board and thus had a heavier car.
Alonso would be eliminated after 41 laps in a driving accident.
Heikki Kovalainen driving for Renault finally leads to a first podium finish for the team in this season, the Finn managed to get second place.
Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber both nearly finished on the podium, but a collision between their Toro Rosso and Red Bull sponsored vehicles took them out of the race.
Renault-engined cars did well in the race with David Coulthard and Giancarlo Fisichella finishing in 4th and 5th places.
Robert Kubica got a drive through the pit-lane penalty after some dangerous driving and a collision with Hamilton, causing the Polish driver to be rolled back to 7th place.
Felipe Massa took 6th place for Ferrari in his hard battle with Kubica in the sprint to the finish line.
Vitantonio Liuzzi rounded out the top eight for Toro Rosso.

Kimi narrowed the gap to the McLaren drivers, now only five points behind Alonso.
Hurricane Dean hit the coast of Mexico's mainland today as a Category 2 hurricane, with winds sustained at 100 mph.
Dean moved across the Bay of Campeche, eyeing over 100 oil platforms and several oil ports in the center of the country's oil industry.
Over 14,000 workers in the area had to be evacuated.
The eye of the storm hit Tecolutla, a major tourist town.
Currently, there are no reports of deaths or serious injuries following the landfall in Mexico.
However, the storm caused major damage to some areas with very heavy rains shutting down many roadways and flooding many homes.
Overall Dean is being blamed for at least 20 deaths in the Caribbean.
The storm has since been downgraded to Category 1 status.
British singer Amy Winehouse died today in her London home in Camden Square, aged 27.
The cause of death is not yet known and is being treated as unexplained, according to the metropolitan police.
On arrival, officers found the body of a 27-year-old female who was pronounced dead at the scene, said a police statement on their website.
An ambulance was called to her address where paramedics reported her dead on the scene at around 1600 local time (1500 UTC) in London.
Winehouse previously had problems with drugs and alcohol and checked herself out of rehab in June.
At least 400 homes have been evacuated in Sierra Madre near Los Angeles, California after a wildfire which started on Saturday, began to threaten their homes.
So far only five percent of the 350 acre fire is contained, with over 400 firefighters battling the blaze.
Authorities say that it has been over 40 years since some parts of the land have caught fire.
Authorities say the investigation into how it started may take up to three days to finish.
So far there have been no injuries and no homes have yet been damaged, but one building storing equipment used by firefighters was burned to the ground.
For a short time, at least 100 hikers were trapped in the mountains and a boy scout camp was also threatened by the blaze.
Several people celebrating a wedding have also been trapped by the fire but are not injured and authorities say they are in no danger from the blaze.
However, there are currently around 1000 people under mandatory evacuations, and the city has been declared in a state of emergency.
It could take at least five days before the fire can be brought under full control.
Portions of Wikileaks.org, the uncensorable Wikipedia for untraceable mass document leaking and analysis, has been blocked in Australia.
Wikinews has also learned that three URL links to Wikipedia, a free, online encyclopedia anyone can edit, have also been blocked.
Portions of the video sharing website YouTube have also been blocked.
The websites are among thousands of others that the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), a government owned entity, block access to when using their blocking software.
The alleged three lists, from 2008 and 2009, were leaked to Wikileaks who published the documents.
Most of the blocked websites are ones hosting hardcore pornography.
According to their website, the ACMA's role in regards to the internet is to address community concerns about offensive and illegal material online and, in particular, to protect children from exposure to material that is unsuitable for them.
Despite the alleged leak, Stephen Conroy, the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy in Australia, much of the listed websites were never an issue with the ACMA, but that some of the websites are.
He also goes on to say that anyone publishing the content of the ACMA's list will face criminal prosecution.
I am aware of reports that a list of URLs has been placed on a website.
ACMA is investigating this matter and is considering a range of possible actions it may take including referral to the Australian Federal Police.
Any Australian involved in making this content publicly available would be at serious risk of criminal prosecution, said Conroy in a statement to the press.
Wikileaks insists the list is real and that publishing the three of them reflects what ones were added in the past, then removed or vice versa.
Between the 11th and yesterday, the company did an enormous cleanup of the list.
No doubt as a result of the list appearing on Wikileaks.
Where the list previously contained over 2000 URLs, and Conroy and the ACMA claimed 'See! Our 'current list' never contained that many URLs', this new list is about the size the ACMA claimed it to be, said Wikileaks in a statement posted on their website.
Wikileaks recently leaked documents that revealed the ACMA's alleged list of 2,395 blocked websites, portions of Wikileaks being among them.
Of the three lists, the final one shows that the ACMA cleaned up their list, according to Wikileaks.
One of the blacklisted URLs to Wikileaks includes a leaked list of blocked websites in Denmark.
Not included on the list is the leaked list of blocked websites in Thailand.
This week saw Australia joining China and the United Arab Emirates as the only countries censoring Wikileaks.
Australian democracy must not be permitted to sleep with this loaded gun.
If Australia's 'Senator for Censorship', Steven Conroy, has his way, Australia will be the first Western country to have a mandatory Internet censorship regime, said Wikileaks in another statement on their website.
The first rule of censorship is that you cannot talk about censorship.
Portions of Wikipedia blocked include a photo taken by Wikinews contributor David Shankbone titled The making of an adult film by David Shankbone.
The URL was added to the ACMA's list on July 28, 2008.
However, Wikinews has learned that the file was deleted from Wikimedia Commons on January 21, by Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales by user request Courtesy delete per request of uploader.
It was deleted more than one year after the ACMA added the URL to its list.
Other portions of Wikipedia that are blocked are pages belonging to users Cyde and Ewlyahoocom.
Wikinews contacted the ACMA for a statement, but as of this report, there was no response.
Wikinews also contacted Mr. Wales who confirmed the file was deleted because he was asked to do so.
This had nothing to do with Australia, said Wales to Wikinews.
Wales did not say whether he was aware of the specific file linked to Wikipedia was being blocked.
The Wikipedia URLs appear on all three lists leaked by Wikileaks.
Another image, in the same photo set was also deleted by Mr. Wales on the same day, but that URL does not appear on the alleged ACMA list.
It underwent a request for deletion in 2008, which was later deleted despite it being discussed as 'keep'.
An anonymous source told Wikinews that the images were sexually explicit and featured three men, pornography star Michael Lucas, Rodrigo diCarli and Kurt Wild, having anal intercourse.
Shankbone told Wikinews that he has no comment for this story.
Websites caught linking to or promoting websites on the ACMA's block list could face a fine of AU$11,000 per day if they don't remove the content in question within 24 hours of receiving a notice from the ACMA.
The same standard can be enforced on an international level.
Fines can be imposed on websites outside Australia that link to material on its list.
The MTR Corporation, the only railway company in Hong Kong since the rail merge in 2007, has loosened their rules.
The corporation proposed the new modifications, then transferred the proposal to the Legislative Council, and will be effective from September 2010.
The new set of rules allow 'non-disruptive' use of profanity in private conversations, and the punishment for inflammatory use of expletives is lowered from a fine of HK$5000 to HK$2000.
The new set of rules have also excluded the regulation against wandering in MTR premises, as well as the rule against attempting to eat or drink.
Democratic Party member James To has expressed his concerns about a new rule that outlaws the display of promotional material.
According to To, the wearing of Tiananmen Square Incident-related T-shirts or acting the Goddess of Democracy may breach the new MTR rules.
He also deems two other regulations, namely the prohibition of distracting MTR staff members and photography and video-recording in the train carriages, 'unreasonable'.
Unionist Li Fung-ying is also confused whether chewing gum was considered food.
MTR head of operations Choi Tak-tsan replied that only what is regarded as food counts.
They had not yet discussed on this matter, said Choi, and will soon.
Li is also concerned about the rule which prohibits the entering of the first-class carriage without buying a ticket.
Her main concern is whether the passenger will be allowed to buy the ticket rather than being fined HK$500.
Wong Kwok-hing believes that the MTR corporation should call upon more effort to advertise a more 'civilised' and 'polite' way of taking the train.
Jeffrey Lam thinks that the new rules do not do enough to restrict shouting.
MTR replied that anyone who shouts in the train can be advised to leave the train or even prosecuted.
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) that started preliminary experiments on September 10, 2008 in CERN,Geneva, and the planned International Linear Collider (ILC) will carry out a series of experiments in the future to validate the standard model of particle physics.
The model predicts that Higgs boson particles gives mass to all fundamental particles and explains the existence of dark matter, or invisible matter in between galaxies.
The LHC is a 27 kilometer long circular high energy particle accelerator which took more than 20 years and USD $9 billion to build.
In the next few weeks the machine will collide opposing beams of protons charged with approximately 7 TeV of energy resulting in cataclysmic conditions that will mimic the beginning of time, a re-creation of the Big Bang.
An upgraded version of the LHC was announced, nicknamed the super LHC.
The new accelerator will perform ten times the number of collisions as the current LHC over the same time.
The upgrade will feature a new injection system and enhanced detectors to cope with the increase in data packets from collisions.
The bigger International Linear Collider, nicknamed Einstein's telescope, is planned by the International Technology Recommendation Panel (ITRP).
The ILC will have a collision energy of 500 GeV and will collide electrons with particles of antimatter, called positrons, along a 30-40 km completely straight tunnel.
The ILC's two giant guns pointing at each other would be able to accelerate electrons and positrons to near-light speeds before smashing them together.
The LHC smashes protons together to discover new particles but also generates lots of debris that obscures the fine detail.
The ILC would be a much cleaner machine and tell us far more about their real nature.says Brian Foster, professor of experimental physics at Oxford University and European director of the project.
The host country for the ILC has not yet been chosen but it is planned to have the machine constructed by late 2010.
The new machine will cost an estimated USD $7 billion to build.
Physicists hope that ILC might be able to resolve some of the questions raised by Einstein's theories of relativity.
Astronauts and ground controllers are looking at apparent damage to the International Space Station P6 4B solar array spotted by the crew during deployment.
NASA halted the deployment of the solar array wing to evaluate the damage.
Deployment is about 75 percent complete with 25 of 31 bays deployed.
The crew has been asked to photograph the area on the solar array wing and downlink the images to the ground.
Shuttle Discovery is presently docked to the ISS during mission STS-120.
The Church of England are planning to allow gay men who are celibate and in a civil partnership to become bishops according to an announcement made by the House of Bishops.
This expands a previous decision made in 2005 allowing gay clergy with civil partners.
Whether gay clergyman would be allowed to become bishops became an issue in 2003 with the appointment of Rev Jeffrey John as Bishop of Reading.
Jeffrey John was forced to step down from his position and now serves as Dean of St Albans Cathedral.
In 2010, he was also a candidate to become Bishop of Southwark but was rejected, allegedly because of his sexual orientation.
Anglican evangelicals have suggested such a change ought to have been passed by the General Synod rather than the House of Bishops.
Chris Sugden from Anglican Mainstream said the change coming from the House of Bishops looks too much like salami-slicing away at the Church's teaching.
Former Bishop of Rochester Michael Nazir-Ali raised questions about what celibacy means for a gay bishop Does the admission of those in civil partnerships to the episcopate, who state they are celibate, include those who were previously in actively homophile relationships including with their present partner
The House of Bishops statement does not elaborate on this point but it is crucial to an understanding of what celibacy might mean in this context.
In November, the General Synod voted against proposals to allow the appointment of women as bishops.
The available information about the phosphorous cloud following the railway accident in the Ukraine last Monday is becoming more and more cryptic.
The political involvement of most media and other factors are causing contradictions among official sources that are making press work extremely hard.
Moreover, no one is permitted to enter the accident location.
The site of the accident was closed to visitors following the injury of three TV journalists who got too close.
The BBC's political debate show Question Time aired a special edition from Shanghai yesterday.
This was the first time that a political show from the West was made in China.
The show was broadcast on BBC One and BBC World; however, it wasn't shown in China, as a condition of the programme amid fears that it would be inflammatory and present negative views of the government.
The panel contained the Chinese politician Liu Jianchao,who is the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman and Long Yongtu who is General Secretary for the Boao Forum for Asia, together with Chris Patten, the last Governor of Hong Kong, Isobel Hilton, a writer who has a large knowledge of China & David Tang, fashion designer.
The audience contained a mixture of Chinese and Westerners together with people invited by the government.
The questions concerned, among other things, the next chief-executive of Hong Kong, China's attitudes toward Taiwan, whether China has growing problems concerning spoilt children, the growing human rights question, and whether China will economically overtake America in 20 years time.
Many members of the audience liked the show and hoped a similar show will be broadcast in China, in a few years time.
The program, which was part of a week-long BBC focus on China, was hailed as a sign that China was becoming more liberal and accommodating to Western media presence and involvement in China.
The mayor of Champaign, Illinois denies that Barack Obama is eligible to hold the highest office in the United States, joining others who question the validity of the president's birth certificate.
You know, if you're not willing to produce an original certificate like a birth certificate, then you've got something to hide.
The Republican, three-term mayor of the central Illinois city made the comment to a man holding a video camera during a Tea Party protest at West Side Park in Champaign.
The man who recorded him apparently was an anti-Tea Party student from the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign.
Schweighart's concerns reflect those held by some Tea Party proponents and birthers, who claim that Obama is not eligible to be the president because he was not born in the United States.
Although officials in Hawaii have confirmed that Obama was born there, birthers still insist that he has not proven his constitutional eligibility as a natural born citizen.
Champaign County Board member Al Kurtz, declaring himself flabbergasted by the remarks, has called on the mayor to resign.
It's a ridiculous statement to make, and that's why I felt like he polarized the city with those kinds of bias.
I think from this statement, it will make him a very ineffective mayor, he said.
Other local politicians are less concerned by Schweighart's comment, such as city council member Marci Dodds, who does not believe the mayor should resign.
I respect the mayor greatly but I am somewhat disheartened by his comments.
If we all get fired for making dumb comments, we'd sure be moving around a lot, she said.
In the case of a Marine who fired upon an unarmed and wounded Iraqi in a mosque in November 2004, the U.S. Naval Criminal Investigative Service, headed by Major General Richard Natonski, ruled that the soldier acted in self-defense, and within the law of armed conflict.
In a statement released by the Marine Corps He has determined that the actions of the Marine in question were consistent with the established rules of engagement, the law of armed conflict and the Marine's inherent right of self-defense.
In a videotape of the event, the Camp Pendleton U.S. marine raises his weapon and fires into the body of a Iraqi lying up against a wall in a mosque.
When the Marine approached the wounded man, the marine is heard on the videotape saying, He's f faking he's dead; he's faking he's f dead.
Then he fired his rifle point-blank at the man's head, at which point a companion said, Well, he's dead now.
The shootings occurred inside a mosque during a U.S. offensive that led to house-to-house fighting in southern Falluja last November.
A television journalist embedded with the Marines recorded the killing on videotape.
The man killed was one of several Iraqi insurgents who had been wounded in fighting and then disarmed by marines, who then moved on leaving the wounded men in the mosque.
The next day a second line of marines moved through the area, who fought with more insurgents.
Due to the time that had passed since the first wave of marines, the second line assumed that any buildings could have been re-occupied by insurgents.
The corporal found wounded men in the mosque when they searched it.
At that moment marines from the first line of attack were approaching the mosque, among them the journalist, who had also been there the first time.
When they entered the journalist taped what he saw, the same people who were left there, disarmed.
Some were still alive and one marine thought a man lying on the ground was a threat because one of his arms was not clearly visible, so he could be hiding a weapon.
However, instead of keeping him covered so another could search him he shot him, while the journalist was taping it.
When the marine saw this and heard that these men had already been disarmed before he shouted that he didn't know that.
In sworn testimony, the corporal said he thought the people in the mosque were a threat.
A known tactic of anti-Iraqi forces (AIF) is to feign injury or death, and the marine could reasonably claim they were still a threat.
The evidence supports the conclusion that the shooting of all three AIF by the corporal during the assault on the mosque was consistent with the ROE (rules of engagement).
The evidence indicates that based on the actions of those AIF, the corporal reasonably believed that they posed a hostile threat to him and his fellow Marines and justifiably fired in self-defense.
The enhanced videotape of the shooting supports the corporal's claim that the wounded AIF was concealing his left arm behind his head.
While it is not clear whether the AIF in the videotape made any overtly threatening gestures, it is clear that the Marines of 31, to include the corporal, were aware that feigning death was a common enemy TTP (tactics, techniques & procedures).
Accordingly, it was reasonable to believe that the corporal fired on the AIF after reasonably believing that the individual was committing a hostile act by exhibiting a known enemy TTP (feigning death and subsequently moving his concealed arm).
Based on all the evidence in the case, and the rules of engagement that were in effect at the time, it is clear that the corporal could have reasonably believed that the AIF shown in the videotape posed a hostile threat justifying his use of deadly force.
Kevin Sites, the NBC TV journalist who taped the event as pool footage, was embedded with the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment when it neutralized Fallujah.
The incident in the mosque raised considerable controversy over whether embedded journalists should maintain a neutral point of view.
The unedited footage was aired extensively by Al Jazeera over the months following the incident.
Sharif Hikmat Nashashibi of the Arab Media Watch said the footage would support the idea in the Middle East that the prime concern of US forces is not the welfare of Iraqis.
In the USA, however, the shooting itself was not shown because NBC considered it too shocking.
Now that Sites is no longer embedded he wants to bring the whole story out in the open.
Despite the fact that Sites introduced the footage with a long explanation of how the soldiers were under a lot of stress, which could easily cloud their judgement, he received thousands of hate-mails per day and even death-threats
Sites later responded to the criticism in an open letter to the regiment in his weblog.
A roadside bomb in the Iraq capital Baghdad has killed four people, including two journalists working for television network CBS.
The two journalists, cameraman Paul Douglas and soundman James Brolan, both British, were embedded with the American 4th Infantry Division and were on a routine patrol when a nearby car packed with explosives was detonated.
An U.S. army officer and an Iraqi interpreter were also killed.
CBS correspondent Kimberly Dozier, who the journalists were working with, was seriously injured and was flown to an U.S. military hospital to receive surgery.
With the addition of these two journalists, Iraq is now the deadliest war for reporters in the past century, according to Editor and Publisher, the total coming to seventy-one.
This compares to sixty-nine reporters killed during World War Two, and sixty-three in Vietnam.
Alexander Downer, Australia's foreign affairs minister, told the Cole Inquiry yesterday that it was not his department's job to investigate claims that wheat exporter AWB was paying kickbacks to Saddam Hussein in the lead up to the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.
Mr Downer, who entered the inquiry via a back entrance to avoid the crowd waiting outside told the inquiry numerous times that he did not read a series of diplomatic cables which raised concerns about AWB in Iraq.
Mr Downer admitted that he did not have the time to read diplomatic cables and the only time he did so was when he is stuck on a plane and has nothing else to read.
The claims are in stark contrast to a statement made to parliament in February where Mr Downer said Of course I would have read them.
When asked why the department of foreign affairs and trade did nothing about the allegations first received in 2000, he told the inquiry that his department couldn't investigate AWB and responsibility for the oil for food program laid with the UN.
The department does not have the legal authority to go into AWB and access their files he said.
They (the UN) also had people on the ground in Iraq because insofar as there could be infringements of the sanctions regime, those infringements could take place within Iraq and Australia had no access to Iraq during that period.
Mr Downer admitted that the department of foreign affairs and trade had dealt with each cable, despite he not reading them and that were satisfied with assurances from AWB that there was no substance to the allegations.
Mr Downer was also asked about an unassessed intelligence report, sent to the National Security Committee of cabinet which raised concerns about Alia, the Jordanian trucking company used by the AWB to transport wheat around Iraq.
The document alleged that Alia may have been paying kickbacks to the Iraqi regime.
Mr Downer told the inquiry that the intelligence may not have been dealt with.
There is so much intelligence.
It's a very major challenge, to deal with intelligence he said.
When asked by Terry Forrest, counsel for AWB executives what the point of sending intelligence to his department when it was never read, Mr Downer conceded that it was physically impossible to read it all.
Mr Downer was also questioned about a cable delivered in June 2003 from US army captain Puckett which claimed that every contract under the UN's oil for food program contained a kickback.
Mr Downer told the inquiry he didn't see the cable as being important because the information was provided by a junior officer in the US army.
Mr Downer denied claims made by former AWB executive Andrew Lindberg that he had been told about the possibility that money may have been paid to Iraq by Alia.
According to Mr Downer it is common practice in his department to have two advisors at such meetings, where one of them takes notes so there is a record of what is said.
According to Mr Downer, no notes were taken during the meeting despite it being the usual practice.
Mr Downer told the inquiry that he had no idea why notes weren't taken during the meeting, despite the meeting being quite important.
He also told the inquiry that he couldn't recall if he noticed that nobody was taking notes as he would have been focused a little more on the meeting than on somebody taking notes.
Microprocessor company Intel Corporation has quit the board of directors for the One Laptop Per Child association (OLPC), a non-profit organization that aims to provide children in developing countries with inexpensive laptops.
An Intel spokesman cited a philosophical impasse as the reason for the split.
Intel joined the OLPC board in July 2007, agreeing to give financial and technological support to the project.
Development began on a new laptop using an Intel processor rather than the current processor made by Advanced Micro Devices, a rival of Intel.
A prototype of this machine was expected to be unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in Les Vegas, Nevada, which begins in a few days.
According to Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy, OLPC had repeatedly asked Intel to abandon its support for the Classmate PC, a similar laptop designed for children in developing countries, and focus entirely on the OLPC program.
At the end of the day, we decided we couldn't accommodate that request, Mulloy said.
OLPC President Walter Bender said in an interview that Intel's resignation will have no impact on the program.
We never really got much going with Intel to have an impact, Bender said.
He criticized Intel for a seemingly half-hearted effort in developing the new laptops and for using the agreement to make marketing statements.
Tournament hosts France slumped to a shock defeat against Argentina in the opening match of the 2007 Rugby World Cup.
France looked shaky, making errors throughout and Argentina took the lead early on through penalties from Felipe Contepomi.
Ignacio Corleto scored the only try of the match for Argentina in the 27th minute, but Contepomi missed the conversion, hitting the post.
At half time Argentina led by 17 points to 9, with all France's points coming from penalties scored by David Skrela.
Although France improved in the second half, Argentina's strong defence held them off and France were only able to close the lead to five points when David Skrela scored his fourth penalty of the match in the 60th minute.
Skrela and his replacement Frederic Michalak both missed penalties, damaging French chances of a comeback.
This is the first time that the French have lost during the pool stages of the World Cup.
2003 champions England start defending their title tomorrow when they play the United States.
Australia face Japan while New Zealand, who are one of the favourites to win the tournament, play Italy.
Floods in the Algerian town of GhardaÃ¯a which is in the M'zab Valley, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, have killed at least 29 people according to local officials and Ali Belkhir, the head of public health for the north African country.
Belkhir confirmed that following these floods, we can sadly declare that 29 people have died.
He also said that 84 people were injured, although the Algerian interior ministry has since lowered the toll to 48.
Six hundred homes were also flooded in the incident, and several hundred people were evacuated by helicopter.
According to reports on Algerian national radio, there may also be undiscovered damage in towns nearby GhardaÃ¯a, which is approximately 600 kilometres from the Algerian capital, Algiers.
The flooding was caused by storms that flooded a seasonal river, known locally as a wadi, which can rise quickly by around 8 metres.
A judge in Montana yesterday released Barry Beach after 28 years and eleven months behind bars.
Beach confessed to a 1979 killing but has since maintained his innocence and now he's been granted a new trial.
Residents of the suburb of Minyama, Australia have come to a compromise with restaurant chain McDonald's.
A 24 hour store was planned for the suburb but the fast food giant backed down agreeing that the store will only open overnight on Fridays and Saturdays.
Every other day it will be open from five in the morning to eleven at night.
As part of the compromise, a walkway connecting the suburb's main road to the residential area near the new McDonald's has been closed off.
They will all be restricted to Nicklin Way, said John Meyer-Gleaves, a spokesperson for protest group Say No To McDonald's, referring to late night customers.
The group also managed to get a higher wall placed between the store and the residential area to cut noise and light pollution.
In December, Sunshine Coast Regional Council knocked backed the then-proposed store with mayor Bob Abbot expressing concern about its proximity to a residential area.
I'm pretty sure I'm the only councillor who already has a 24-hour McDonald's in my division, we have enough issues with that one, and this is overkill, Councillor Chris Thompson, Division 4 in the Sunshine Coast Regional Council, had said about a 24 hour seven day a week store at Minyama.
The 24-hour McDonald's in Councillor Thompson's division, Mooloolaba, is part of a larger complex and does not back onto residential premises.
Yemeni government officials reported that Yemeni armed forces have killed over 100 Zaidi Shia rebel fighters following a battle to capture a town in the country's north.
In a statement, the government said that the bodies of more than 100 rebels have been recovered from the roadside outside the town of Harf Sufyan.
It seems that the bodies were those of rebels who were trying to flee the town during a mopping-up operation over the past two days.
The statement also said that two commanders, Mohsen Saleh Hadi Gawd and Salah Jorman, were identified among the dead.
The government statement said the Yemeni forces totally [purged] the town of rebel elements in the past two days, forcing the rebels to surrender or flee.
The Zaidi insurgent group, also known as Houthis, have been fighting for northern independence for the past half decade.
Two weeks ago, the Yemeni government started Operation Scorched Earth to try to exterminate the insurgents.
Harf Sufyan is a town in Yemen's northern mountain range.
It is about seventy kilometres north of Sana'a, the country's capital.
A van carrying around thirty-three people crashed into the Alamatti reservoir on the Krishna river in north Karnataka, killing 25 people while the rest managed to swim to safety.
The passengers, including women and children, were from Bagsibundu village in Koppal district and were going to visit the Alamatti dam after going on a pilgrimage to Koodalasangama.
District officials rushed to the spot and initiated efforts to rescue survivors and extricate the bodies of the deceased.
Chief Minister of Karnataka, H.D Kumaraswamy expressed shock over the accident.
After a 3-1 victory in the 2nd game of the UEFA-Women's Cup final 2005 the players of the 1.FFC Turbine Potsdam have won the European championship against the Swedish team of DjurgÃ¥rden  Ã„lvsjÃ¶ - the UEFA Women's cup.
A 73-year old retired pastor, Reverend Roland Weisselberg, burned himself alive during Reformation Day services on Tuesday]in Erfurt, Germany.
His self-immolation was apparently in protest against the spread of Islam, which he felt the Protestant church should take more seriously.
His last words were Jesus and Oskar,, believed to a reference to Oskar Bruesewitz, a priest who burned himself alive to protest the Communist government of East Germany.
He was transported to a burns unit in Halle but died en route.
Rev. Weisselberg had lived under Communism in East Germany, and had been a publisher in his former vocation.
Axel Noack, Bishop of Saxony, said that he was shocked at Rev. Weisselberg's self-immolation, stressing that Christians could not accept a clash of cultures.
He confessed that the issue of Islam had been sidelined within the Church and was only spoken about in private.
There were few Muslims there with whom they could engage in dialogue, Noack said.
Following a dispute with London-based company Independent International Investment Research (IIIR), Internet company Google Inc. has dropped the use of its Gmail name for its free email service.
IIIR launched its own web-based email service called Gmail more than two years prior to Google's own service.
All other countries (except Germany, where a similar dispute also resulted in a name change) will continue to use the Gmail name and domain (gmail.com).
The change took place on Wednesday, when all new Gmail accounts created from a UK IP address will use the @googlemail.com domain, instead of the former @gmail.com.
As the service is still invite-only, invitations for the service will also be made for the @googlemail.com domain.
Former UK Gmail users will continue to use the @gmail.com domain for the near future.
Two bombs detonated in the GÃ¼ngÃ¶ren district of Istanbul, Turkey Sunday evening, killing at least 17 people and wounding over 150.
The neighborhood targeted is mainly residential, and the victims were civilians.
At least five of those killed were children, according to local officials.
This bombing was the worst terrorist attack in Istanbul since the 2003 Istanbul Bombings, in which truck bombs exploded outside two Istanbul synagogues, killing 23 and wounding more than 300.
The initial explosion caused little damage, but attracted crowds of onlookers.
The second more lethal blast occurred 10 minutes later, about 50 metres away.
After the first explosion, I rushed outside to check on my two sons, found both of them.
But my elder son insisted on going back to find his father, said Nimet Arslan to International Herald Tribune.
Following the second bomb, she said, a dark smoke filled the air and all I could see or hear was people screaming.
Turkish President Abdullah GÃ¼l said in a statement, Nothing can be achieved by terror, violently claiming lives of the innocent.
These attacks show the inhumanity and misery of the assailants.
It is not yet clear who is responsible, but Turkish authorities suspect the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a Kurdish separatist group.
Of course, there are links with the separatist organization, the governor of Istanbul province, Muammer GÃ¼ler said, It's surely a terror attack, thereâ€™s no doubt.
This follows a recent shooting attack on the United States consulate in Istanbul.
On Sunday, the Turkish military announced that its fighter jets had raided twelve PKK settlements in Northern Iraq, which the PKK uses as a base to launch attacks on Turkey, raising speculation of PKK involvement in this attack.
However Zubeyir Aydar, a senior Kurdish militant, denied any involvement in the attacks in a statement to a pro-PKK news agency.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan visited the site on Monday, calling for calm and nationwide solidarity.
Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj has announced a moratorium on executions, and will begin to seek their abolition.
On January 14, 2010, in a speech to parliament, Elbegdorj announced that he would pardon all persons sentenced to death, stating that most countries in the world had abolished the death penalty, and Mongolia should follow suit.
He also suggested that the death penalty be replaced with a 30 year prison sentence.
The decision was controversial when Elbegdorj finished his speech, representatives of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party refused to join in the applause, which is customary after a presidential address to parliament.
Human rights groups welcomed the move, with Amnesty International expressing hope that Mongolia will vote in favour of an upcoming United Nations resolution calling for an end to Capital punishment.
It also urged other nations in the region to abolish the death penalty.
Many members of Mongolia's opposition-led parliament favour harsh punishments for criminals, and Elbegdorj must gain approval from parliament before the death penalty can be abolished.
If Elbegdorj fails to be re-elected, the new president could end the moratorium, and executions could resume.
Mozambique's main opposition party has rejected the results of last month's national elections, alleging fraud and ballot-stuffing.
Official results were released on Wednesday confirming that President Armando Guebuza had won another term in office.
The secretary-general of the opposition Renamo Party, Ussufo Momade, announced his party's rejection of the election results, saying there had been widespread fraud.
We demand the cancellation of the results that were just announced and we insist on a new vote.
The National Electoral Commission said Wednesday that Guebuza had received more than 75% of the valid votes cast two weeks ago.
The National Electoral Commission declares that Armando Emilio Guebuza has been elected president of the Republic of Mozambique for five years, the commission stated.
The president's Frelimo Party also won 191 of the 250 seats in parliament.
Before the elections, Frelimo had 160 seats and Renamo 90.
Frelimo has been in power since 1975, when Mozambique declared independence from Portugal.
Renamo's candidate, Afonso Dhlakama, received 16% of the vote, while the leader of a new party, Daviz Simango of the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM), received 8%.
Sixteen other parties were also in contention for parliament seats, but none of them received more than one percent of the vote.
Frelimo, which has a two-thirds majority in the parliament, has a sufficient number of seats to alter the constitution without support from other parties.
There has been some speculation that Frelimo may use this to allow Guebuza to run for a third term - currently, the constitution allows a president to serve only two terms in office.
Senior Frelimo party members, however, promised that Guebuza had no intention of seeking another term.
The majority in parliament will give us more freedom to choose what is best for Mozambican people.
And that is what we will continue to do in the next mandate, said Frelimo election officer Veronica Macamo.
Soon after the election results were announced, Renamo alleged that there had been widespread ballot-stuffing in some districts, and that its observers had been expelled from others.
The MDM also protested, saying ballots had been tampered with at some stations, and produced a cell phone video showing election officials apparently tampering with ballots.
The party also made a list of alleged voting irregularities, which was given to media and election observers.
He also rejected the electoral body's verdict that the poll was credible.
What the CNE is saying is what Frelimo tells them to say.
But what the international community didn't know is that those polling station agents were actually recruited to stuff the ballot boxes.
If that was not the case, why did they arrest most of our polling station watchers
That is exactly to create the opportunity for them to do the stuffing, he said.
An observation consortium of religious and civic groups conducted a parallel tabulation of the vote in eight percent of the stations nationwide.
The group said there were indications of irregularities in six percent of the voting stations.
Voter turnout nationwide was 45%, but some stations reported a turnout of 95% or more, raising suspicions that there was ballot stuffing involved.
Other voting stations reported a turnout of 15% or less.
Many ballots were disqualified because they had a check-mark beside the face of one candidate, but a fingerprint beside the face of another.
Some observers concluded that such fraud might have affected the outcome in one of the contests for parliament, and several of those for the provincial assemblies.
Most international observers, however, had deemed the elections fair and free, although there had been some criticism that the electoral commission had disqualified MDM candidates for all but four provincial assemblies on technical grounds.
The pre-election phase was characterized by peaceful, tolerant and yet enthusiastic political atmosphere.
There was clear evidence of vigor and enthusiasm among political parties as they conducted their campaigns, said the South African Development Community (SADC), which sent 98 observers to oversee the elections.
The national elections commission stated that no official complaints of voting irregularity were submitted to them.
Political parties have two days after the voting day to present complaints or proof of irregularities.
We did not receive any complaints during this period, said the chairman of Mozambique's National Elections Commission, Leopoldo da Costa.
Bayern Munich's #1 goalkeeper Oliver Kahn striker Miroslav Klose have been ruled out of Thursday's UEFA Cup 1st Round 2nd Leg match against Portugal's Belenenses.
Oliver Kahn will require elbow surgery and will be out for five weeks.
Bastian Schweinsteiger, Marcell Jansen and Luca Toni didn't practice today for precautionary reasons.
Michael Rensing will replace Oliver Kahn in net while it's not known what formation Ottmar Hitzfeld will use on Thursday.
In Goma, on the eastern side of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), at least 70 people, according to officials, have died because when a McDonnell Douglas DC-9 crashed on take off yesterday.
VOA has reported that as many as 100 people could have been on board the plane at the time of its crash.
A director of Hewa Bora Airways, the airline involved in the incident said that we [the airline] have managed to save most of the passengers who have been evacuated to hospitals.
Naomi Schwarz, a journalist on the scene described the incident.
The whole top of the plane is ripped off and the two buildings next door are pretty much destroyed too.
People are carrying buckets full of water to try to put out the fire.
As of 0800 UTC, the majority of the Hewa Bora website was not available.
Bolton Wanderers opened the scoring after only eight minutes when Ricardo Gardner scored on a deflected shot.
After taking 15 minutes to settle in, Bayern Munich started to attack more frequently and it paid dividends after 30 minutes when Lukas Podolski equalized.
Early in the 2nd half Bayern Munich took the lead when Podolski got his 2nd goal of the game.
However, with 8 minutes left, Bolton equalized which earned Bolton's 2nd point in the group stage while Bayern lead Group F with 4 points.
If Bayern Munich wins their next UEFA Cup match, they are all but assured their place in the next round.
In an attempt at a world first twenty short-tailed bats are to be moved by the New Zealand Department of Conservation from the Tararua Ranges to Kapiti Island.
If the transfer to predator-free Kapiti works, it will become the first time that bats have ever been trans-located.
All previous attempts at moving bats have failed due to their natural homing instincts.
However scientists with the Department of Conservation, are aiming to overcome this by shifting juveniles.
Conservation Minister Chris Carter said that while the trial was risky, it was also worthwhile.
A willingness to push boundaries and try new things is exactly what conservation in New Zealand needs, he said.
At least 19 people have been killed in central Florida in the city of Lady Lake and Paisley after severe storms and a tornado ripped through the cities in the middle of the night.
Eleven of those killed were in Paisley and three were in Lady Lake.
The death toll is expected to rise as rescue crews resume tomorrow morning.
Volusia, Sumter, Lake and Seminole counties have all been declared a state of an emergency as dozens of houses, mobile homes and a church were destroyed.
Clothes and furniture are scattered around the wrecked houses and pieces of trees are scattered about.
Cars are reported to have been turned over or thrown around in the air.
Our priority today is search and rescue, said Gov. of Florida, Charlie Crist.
Rescuers are still looking through the wreckage to find survivors of those who might have been killed.
A spokeman for the emergency response team of Lake county, Chris Patton calls the damage devastating and worse than hurricanes in 2004.
We have complete devastation of homes, of businesses, religious institutions.
It was unlike even perhaps the hurricanes of 2004 when we had minor roof damage, screen damage, pool damage.
At least 70 people are dead and hundreds more injured after three earthquakes and several aftershocks rocked western Iran between Doroud and Boroujerd in the Lorestan province at 1106 p.m. local time (1936 GMT) on Thursday.
Some estimates of those injured currently range between 700-1,200 people.
The first earthquake measured a 4.7 on the Richter magnitude scale and was in a mountainous area and the second measured a 5.1.
The third quake measured a 6.0 and hit Doroud and the villages surrounding the area at 447 a.m. local time (0117 GMT) on Friday.
According to the U.S. Geological Survey, however, a 5.7 magnitude quake occurred at 0117 UTC followed by an earthquake of 4.7 magnitude fifteen minutes later.
They also report that the previous day, a quake measuring 4.7 in magnitude occurred in the same area.
Power has been cut to some areas and there are reports of at least 330 villages that have been severely damaged.
Some reports say that at least 20 villages have been destroyed.
In December of 2003, a magnitude 6.6 earthquake killed over 31,000 people and in February of 2005 a 6.4 eathquake killed 600 people near Zarand in the Kerman province.
The European Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee supported on Tuesday a proposal by the European Commission to scrap visa requirements for citizens of Serbia, Montenegro, and Macedonia, starting on January 1 of next year.
The committee also asked that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania be included in the visa liberalisation process, although neither has met EU-determined benchmarks yet.
European Parliament members also want to initiate visa liberalisation dialogues with Kosovo and establish a roadmap for visa-free travel.
Serbia, Macedonia, and Montenegro currently appear to have strong support within the Parliament for implementing the proposal.
â€œI am convinced that what we are trying to do now with Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albania will not slow down the other three countries.
This was a political decision by all the member-states of the European community and that will not change,â€ said Tanja Fajon, the European Parliament Rapporteur on Visa Liberalization.
Microsoft decided to buy a health information search engine called Medstory.
This is the company's first step towards an involvement in the health market.
The software that Medstory develops involves artificial intelligence techniques which are applied to both medical and health information stored in medical journals, as well as government documents.
According to Peter Neupert, vice president for health strategy at Microsoft, the acquisition of Medstory represents the first step in assembling technologies which can serve well for the consumer experience in health care.
Microsoft decided to make its move into the health care system at a time when many websites, that provide various information on health, started to significantly raise their traffic and receive investments.
The industry analyst and Medstory investor, Esther Dyson, mentioned that the technology provided by Medstory is not just a search engine, it also represents an ontology engine.
He also outlined the fact that Microsoft has acquired some of the best deep technology in the fast growing field of medical search engines.
A collision between two United States military helicopters in Iraq that killed four last month has been blamed on enemy fire.
The two OH-58 Kiowa Warriors had been on a mission in Kirkuk when they were targeted and struck each other during evasive action, killing all those on board.
The anouncement on the involvement of hostile fire, which had previously been ruled out, was made at Fort Drum shortly after a memorial service for the two crews, who had been based there.
The Army said that forensic evidence revealed the presence of enemy fire.
The two OH-58D helicopters were engaged and struck by hostile fire while conducting a reconnaissance mission, said a Fort Drum spokeswoman.
The Agence France-Presse was told that the investigation determined that the two OH-58 helicopters involved in the January 25 incident [sic] in Kirkuk province were engaged and struck by hostile fire, and that While executing evasive manoeuvres in response to the hostile fire, the two OH-58s collided, resulting in the catastrophic loss of both aircraft and crews, by a US Army spokesman for northern Iraq.
There is no indication as in to the precise nature of the attack.
Sunni nationalist extremist group Nakshabandiya had handed out leaflets after the attack saying they had shot the aircraft down and would soon show a video, later repeating this claim on their website.
The group has ties to Saddam Hussein's fugitive deputy Izzat Ibrahim al-Duri.
The death toll was the highest for US soldiers in a single event for four months in Iraq.
The four men were Philip E. Windorski Jr., Matthew Kelley, Joshua Tillery and Benjamin Todd, all Warrant Officers with the 10th Mountain Division's 10th Combat Aviation Brigade.
Melbourne Victory has won the A-League Grand Final against Adelaide United at the Telstra Dome.
Melbourne came into the match with a 6-0 (2-0, 4-0) win over Adelaide United in their two legged semi final.
Adelaide United came into the match with a win against Queensland Roar in the preliminary final.
The A-League uses the Page playoff system where the winner of the major semi final (1st vs. 2nd) qualifies for the grand final, while the loser plays the winner of the minor semi final (3rd vs. 4th) for the remaining place.
Melbourne midfielder Tom Pondeljak scored the only goal for the match with a long range strike on sixty minutes.
Adelaide were reduced to ten men after ten minutes when Cristiano landed a clumsy elbow to the head of an opposing player.
Melbourne was reduced to ten men twenty minutes from time when Danny Allsopp was sent off due to a late fracas.
Adelaide were great, they pushed us right to the death but I think we deserved it, Melbourne captain Kevin Muscat said.
Down to 10 men it was a very difficult game for us but the amount of courage and heart the boys showed tonight to get through the game and keep fighting to the end was fantastic.
It's one of those things I guess, it changed the game, but what can you do about it now Adelaide Captain Travis Dodd told Fox Sports after the match.
We worked hard to keep it scoreless until half-time, to keep our discipline and keep our shape and keep doing what we were doing.
Online organisations around the world are today testing (IPv6) â€” a new system of Internet addresses hoped to resolve the issue of the present system being at capacity.
The current standard was set up in the 1980s; it gives everything on the Internet a twelve-digit address and allows for 4.3 billion combinations.
With these exhausted, IPv6 is designed to increase the limit 340 undecillion â€” that's 340 trillion trillion trillion.
Major websites including services run by Google, Facebook, and Yahoo! are taking part in the test, switching their content to use the new system.
Facebook predicts 99.97% of users to be unaffected and Google anticipates 99.5% will not encounter problems.
Fiji and Australia are among the first countries to have business-hours web traffic during the test.
Internet Society of Australia President Tony Hill claims more than 100 global companies are involved.
The Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger plane, was set to land in the United States of America on Monday after a test flight.
One of the A380s is flying from Frankfurt to Chicago via New York; the airplane will be carrying about 500 people.
It is being billed as the first time it has carried a near-normal number of passengers, though most will be staff of Airbus and German airline Lufthansa.
A second A380 is also travelling to the U.S. on Monday, but without passengers.
This will be branded as a Qantas flight and fly from Frankfurt to Los Angeles LAX airport.
The first leg of the flight going towards New York will be travelling under a Lufthansa flight number, and is due to arrive at New York's John F. Kennedy airport at 1230 EST (1630 UTC).
The test flights are being used to monitor everything from how easily the plane docks at the terminal gate to the way the in-flight dining and entertainment services work.
Deliveries to Singapore Airlines, its launch customer, are not due until October - two years late.
Delays of the production of the A380 have cost Airbus more than 6 billion dollars.
Airbus has warned there could be additional charges to come.
These monetary problems have led to a recently-announced restructuring program at Airbus, called Power8, in which 10,000 jobs go and several factories will be sold to Airbus partners.
France will lose 4,300 jobs, followed by Germany having a loss of 3,700 jobs, while the United Kingdom and Spain will see 1,600 and 400 jobs cut respectively.
The Belgian government has announced that it will give up to 150 million â‚¬ (US$ 199 million) in aid to help sub-contractors which supply Airbus and employ thousands of workers.
The UK's Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) announced today a grant of Â£4.6 million towards the restoration of Lews Castle on the Western Scottish island of Stornoway.
Estimates suggest approximately Â£14 million (US$ 21.9m, â‚¬ 16.2m) will be spent to restore and convert the Victorian era property into a museum with four-star hotel accommodation.
Originally built as a home for James Matheson, who made his fortune in the Chinese and Indian opium trade, the castle has lain empty, and on the at-risk register, since the late 1980s.
A gap of Â£1.6 million in required funding remains a concern the local Comhairle nan Eilean Siar (previously, Western Isles Council) is actively seeking help from both Europe and the Scottish government.
Council leader Angus Campbell intends to press the Scottish Government on the final funding; it would be a huge shame if all the other funding is lost, he said.
We are optimistic about getting some European funding, which is absolutely crucial, and are asking the Scottish Government to close the funding gap.
Campbell describes what would be the first UK museum with Gaelic as its primary language as a generational project with benefits throughout the communities of the Outer Hebrides.
Local MSP Alasdair Allan commended the council's efforts to save Lews Castle saying they, and other agencies, have been working tirelessly to progress plans that would ensure Lews Castle becomes both a cultural and economic asset to the islands.
Throughout its colourful history, the castle was at one time owned by William Lever who founded Unilever.
Before gifting the castle to the local people in 1923, Lord Leverhulme invested in electric lighting, central heating, an internal telephone system, and the extension of the ballroom for social gatherings.
In World War II, the castle was the base for a Naval hospital and squadron of amphibious biplanes.
Post-war, it spent 30 years as a technical college and school.
If the final tranche of funding is secured, in 2014 the castle will become the first-ever archive facility in the Western Isles.
The collections of Museum nan Eilean (MnE) could move from their current home into the castle; items held by the National Archives of Scotland could return to their native isles.
And, modern facilities would permit collections from the National Museum of Scotland and the British Museum â€“ such as the Lewis Chessmen â€“ to be exhibited there.
A NATO airstrike has killed at least seven members of the Afghan security forces in the western province of Badghis on Friday, according to the Afghan defence ministry.
Due to a NATO forces air strike on November 6 in Badghis province seven Afghan security personnel (both Afghan army and national police) were martyred and also some were wounded, the ministry stated.
NATO and Afghan authorities are investigating but NATO officials have yet to comment.
Afghan Defence Ministry spokesman, Gen Mohammad Zahir Azimi, said that the airstrike hit a base housing NATO and Afghan troops.
The announcement comes amidst Friday's investigation in Badghis, where more than 25 joint troops sustained injuries whilst searching for two missing United States paratroopers.
According to an anonymous Western military official they were injured by friendly fire.
A politician from Spain's ruling Socialist Party has been killed in Spain's northern Basque region, in the town of Mondragon.
The shooting came just two days before general elections in Spain.
IsaÃ­as Carrasco, 42, was shot outside his house in front of his wife and daughter and was taken to hospital, where he died of his wounds.
No group has claimed the attack but Spanish sources said the attack was probably carried out by the Basque separatist group, considered as a terrorist group by European Union and United States, ETA.
Spain is in the final day of official campaigning ahead of Sunday's general election, in which the Socialist prime minister Rodriguez Zapatero is seeking a second term.
The conservative opposition Partido Popular has focused his campaign in the terrorism and separatism, especially that of the Basque.
After the shooting the main parties announced a halt to campaigning.
According to the polls, the two parties are neck and neck in the race for the election.
According to local media, 25 people have died in an illegal coal mine in central China, after a fire broke out there.
The incident occurred at the mines of the Dongxing Coal Mining Company, near the city of Zhengzhou, the capital of the Henan province.
It is believed that the fire was started by an electrical fault, the Xinhua news agency reports.
There were 31 total miners inside the mine; six were able to escape, but the others burnt to death.
The owner, manager, and an investor of the mine were taken into police custody on Monday.
Their assets, and those of the mine, have been frozen by the authorities.
It was not immediately clear what caused the blaze, although an investigation is underway.
China's mines are the deadliest in the world; according to Al Jazeera, several thousand miners die each year due to accidents in them.
Earlier this month, over 30 people were killed in another coal mine in the northern part of the country, after a flood.
The government has pledged to crack down upon illegal mines and enforce safety rules.
China has joined other members of the United Nations Security Council in openly warning North Korea against future provocations and took several diplomatic measures on Tuesday and Wednesday.
China's foreign ministry released a statement Wednesday that urged a return to talks We believe that maintaining peace and stability on the Korean peninsula is in the interest of all parties ...
The statement came after North Korea's announcement Tuesday that it would no longer honor the testing agreements that have been made with the United States.
The United States halted its food aid, which had been part of the agreements, after Friday's failed launch.
Also on Tuesday, China delivered another stern warning to the nation through its party newspaper Global Times.
In the statement, China expressed impatience with its neighbor and said China's foreign policy toward North Korea would not be hijacked by North Korea's leaders.
Behind the scenes, China has ceased the repatriation of North Korean nationals on Chinese territory.
Diplomatic pressure on North Korea continued this week as the country remained defiant during its celebration Sunday.
Kim Jong-un gave his first formal address on Sunday in the aftermath of Friday's failed attempt to launch a multistage rocket into orbit and in honor of the anniversary of Kim Il-sung's 100th birthday.
North Korea publicly acknowledged that its rocket broke up in flight and over ocean waters before ever taking orbit Friday morning.
The United Nations criticized North Korea over the weekend for a satellite launch that member states saw as a provocative move, which followed shortly after the country's launch.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called the attempt deplorable and said it threatens regional stability.
Corinne Momal-Vanian, UN spokesperson, said, The Secretary-General urges the (North Korean government) not to undertake any further provocative actions that will heighten tension in the region.
The UN Security Council met in a closed session Friday.
Susan Rice, who is both the current UN Security Council president and US ambassador to the United Nations, said, The United States' view of this is quite clear, we have condemned the launch.
We view it as a direct violation of resolution 1718 and 1874.
We think itâ€™s important that the Council respond credibly and we will be working in that direction.
While China is being openly critical of North Korea, it has a veto right on the UN Security Council that has prevented further sanctions.
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said China stood with other member nations of the Security Council in penalizing North Korea for future actions.
In a nation where speeches by leaders are rare, the young North Korean leader on Sunday said, Superiority in military technology is no longer monopolized by imperialists.
The public event finished with the display of a new rocket and it further punctuated Kim Jong-un's call for making the military the nation's number one priority.
Google, the owners of YouTube, claimed in a court briefing today that the one billion dollar lawsuit against the company threatens the way hundreds of millions of people legitimately exchange information.
Viacom Inc. is suing Google over 150,000 videos, for which Viacom owns the copyright, that were allegedly being shown on YouTube.
Google has responded by saying that they followed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which prevents companies from being prosecuted if they bring down copyrighted content as soon as they are made aware of it.
Viacomâ€™s lawsuit challenges the protections of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that Congress enacted a decade ago to encourage the development of services like YouTube, said Google.
Congress recognized that such services could not and would not exist if they faced liability for copyright infringement based on materials users uploaded to their services.
It chose to immunize these services from copyright liability provided they are properly responsive to notices of alleged infringement from content owners.
Looking at the online world today, there is no question that Congress made the correct policy choice, Google continued.
Legitimate services like YouTube provide the world with free and authorized access to extraordinary libraries of information that would not be available without the DMCA -- information created by users who have every right to share it.
Google then claimed that YouTube also fulfills its end of the DMCA bargain, and indeed goes far beyond its legal obligations in assisting content owners to protect their works.
American politician of the Democratic party Dennis Kucinich plans to run for president in 2008 the five-term congressman's spokesman, Andy Juniewicz, said Monday.
Kucinich ran in 2004 and was last in nearly every primary and caucus of that year.
Kucinich began his political career as a Cleveland city councilman and later as the youngest person ever elected mayor of the Midwestern city.
The congressman made his decision to run, according to a written statement, because he felt his own party's leadership was not aggressive enough in opposing the Iraq war.
Kucinich, 60, is a staunch opponent of the Iraq war.
He has advocated cutting off funds for the war, saying that voting for money to maintain or expand the war is incompatible with a position of opposition to it.
He also co-chaired the Congressional Progressive Caucus and is a self-described Wellstone Democrat.
He has been praised as a genuine progressive by a Ralph Nader and in 2003, Kucinich was the recipient of the Gandhi Peace Award.
If elected, he would be the country's first vegan president.
Estonian and Finnish oil spill response vessels are working on cleaning up the oil spill caused by the sinking of the Runner 4.
The Dominican-registered ship sank on March 6 near the Estonian coast in the Gulf of Finland.
This oil disaster may be even worse than the one of February, which was described by the BBC as the worst oil spill that Estonia has ever experienced.
According to The Baltic Times, specialists say that this time up to 40 tons of oil might have leaked into the sea from the Runner 4.
The ship was carrying, according to MTV3, over 100 tons of heavy fuel oil and 35 tons of light fuel oil.
The ship Runner 4 sank due to a collision with another ship, in a convoy following a Russian icebreaker.
The crew managed to leave the ship before it sank.
He says, according to Finland's national broadcasting company (YLE), that the countermeasures should have started a week ago, immediately after the disaster, instead of now.
He said, It's difficult now to get the oil under control.
It's spread all around, and ship traffic is spreading it further.
Finland will be paying the costs of the cleanup, as Estonia did not make an official request for help.
The Estonian Border Guard's representative Helena Loorents says that Finland was not asked for help, as every day spent in the cleaning costs a lot of money.
According to Urmas Raudsepp, the director of Estonia's Institute of Marine Research, the oil spill's location was only found out on Thursday March 16.
The Finnish ships had, however, arrived at the site on the day before.
The wind is over 17 meters per second (38 miles per hour) and it is raining.
The oil spill is moving into waters too shallow for the three Finnish vessels, so they can no longer do their job.
Hylje will be heading back to Finland on March 19 and the other two might follow within a few days.
According to the Estonian paper Postimees, the oil spill is now a kilometer (0.6 mile) away from the Estonian capital of Tallinn.
The U.S. House Committee on International Relations voted Wednesday on a Resolution of Inquiry that would have required the White House and State Department to transmit all information relating to communication with officials of the United Kingdom between January 1, 2002, and October 16, 2002, relating to the policy of the United States with respect to Iraq.
The resolution comes in response to questions that have been raised by senior intelligence officials and information revealed in leaked U.K. documents such as the Downing Street Memo, regarding the handling of pre-war intelligence by the Bush administration, and the planning and execution of the Iraq war.
Originally proposed by Congresswoman Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), the Resolution of Inquiry had 83 co-sponsors at the time of voting, including one Republican member of the International Relations Committee, Jim Leach, who was the only Republican voting in favor of the resolution.
Some members of the committee from each party were absent.
Around 1927, one of his teachers, Alfonso Caso, encouraged what will be the start of his career; he suggested Henestrosa to write the same zapotec myths, legends, and fables, the base of his first book Los Hombres Que DispersÃ³ La Danza, published in 1929.
In addition to his prose and poetry, Henestrosa served in the federal legislature and was a Senator from the state of Oaxaca from 1982 to 1988.
The British Broadcasting Corporation made the announcement that he had died at 1030 GMT in Hawick, in the Scottish Borders â€” his chosen home town.
McLaren started rugby commentating on a BBC radio station in 1953 while he was a reporter with the Hawick Express, a newspaper.
He was awarded an MBE, an OBE and a CBE and retired in 2002.
People have now paid tribute to the man who became known as the voice of rugby.
In a video shown on BBC News Online, HRH The Princess Royal can be quoted as saying that [e]ven if you didn't think that you understood anything about rugby, somehow Bill McLaren gave you the confidence to listen to what he was saying.
Gavin Hastings, who was the former rugby captain for Scotland, said that [f]irst and foremost, Bill was a very proud and passionate Scot but such was his professionalism that you would never really have known that.
He always remained very unbiased in his commentary and I think that that was unquestionably one of his endearing qualities.
He was a wonderful commentator and he just brought the world of rugby into so many people's homes.
John Thorbun, who is the secretary for Hawick Rugby Club, stated We're devastated, obviously â€” we've got a room named after him at the rugby club.
It was very close to his heart, Hawick Rugby Club.
After an investigation, Wikinews has learned that oil spewing from a rupture in the seafloor of the Gulf of Mexico on June 13 was 50 to 60 feet from the Deepwater Horizon leak.
A nearly four and a half minute video posted on YouTube on June 13 was from the Viking Poseidon ROV (Remote Operated Vehicle) 1.
It shows oil and methane leaking from the seafloor at around 248 a.m. on June 13.
The ROV monitors the leak for a minute and even gets covered in a plume of oil and sand before it moved on to the next spot.
Smaller eruptions were seen as the ROV traveled, making the leak locations vary from 50 to 60 feet from the damaged well.
Until now, there was no way to determine the location of the ROVs in relation to the previously leaking Deepwater Horizon well.
Alexander Higgins, an independent computer programmer, developed the 'Gulf Oil Spill ROV UTM Distance Calculator.'
Higgins told Wikinews how he created the calculator, and says it is very accurate, but that the tool would not give you accurate measurements over a large distance, e.g. from the well head to New Orleans.
BP, who owned and operated the Deepwater Horizon, has denied that any oil or methane gas is leaking from the sea floor.
Seismic tests were conducted on July 16; Admiral Thad Allen of the United States Coast Guard said that no anomalies were found, but also that the tests were not comprehensive.
On Sunday, Wikinews contacted BP, who authenticated the video, and asked if any ROVs were sent back to the crack and leak location on June 13 for further investigation.
According to their office in London, England, they sent ROVs to investigate and monitor that and no further signs of oil or gas were found.
They also stated that they have continued to monitor and have also carried out seismic surveys.
Wikinews also asked if they could confirm the location of the leak and crack, but no response was given.
However, on July 18, the Associated Press reported that there was seepage coming from the area at the bottom of the Deepwater well head.
For the past two days, ROV cameras showed bubbles coming from the base of well.
BP said it would test the bubbles to determine what they are and as of Sunday, COO of BP Doug Suttles says the bubbles are not methane, but further tests are being conducted.
If you can imagine, it is not an easy operation to collect those bubbles so that they can be tested to see what their make-up is.
Since the June 13 video surfaced, other videos have been posted to YouTube allegedly showing some of the ROVs being tossed around by large amounts of oil seeping through the seafloor.
One video showed an alleged eruption spraying oil and debris around the BOA DEEP C 2 ROV before it was tossed from side to side.
Some of the cracks on ocean floors, where oil has leaked from, have occurred naturally.
One such oil spill in California in 2005 was the result of a naturally occurring crack in the floor of the Pacific Ocean.
Some of those cracks can cause oil to leak through at a rate as high as 5,000 gallons a day, with most of the oil not even reaching the water's surface.
In the Gulf of Mexico, oil leaks through natural cracks at a rate several times less than leaked from the Deepwater well.
The Deepwater Horizon site releases 3 to 12 times the oil per day compared to that released by natural seeps across the entire Gulf of Mexico.
By May 30, the Deepwater Horizon site had released between 468,000 and 741,000 barrels of oil, compared to 60,000 to 150,000 barrels from natural seeps across the entire Gulf of Mexico over the same 39 day period, said Cutler Cleveland, a Boston University professor at the university's Department of Geography and Environment.
The Deepwater Horizon oil spill started on April 20 after an explosion on the rig.
Efforts to put out the fire failed and the rig subsequently sank to the bottom of the Gulf.
On April 22, an oil slick appeared on the surface of the Gulf.
BP capped the leaking well on July 13 which effectively stopped oil from leaking into the Gulf.
The company has been running a pressure integrity test on the 150,000 pound cap for 48 hours.
Earlier on July 17, they announced the test would continue for another day.
BP hopes for the well's pressure to rise to or above 7,500 PSI.
As of Saturday morning the well's pressure was just above 6,700 PSI.
BP fears anything lower than the expected PSI could mean a leak in the cap or elsewhere, such as oil or methane seeping up from the seafloor.
We will keep monitoring and make the decisions as we go forward.
The longer the test goes the more confidence we have in it, said Allen.
Canon Inc. announced the initiative to start production of new generation flat-panel television on its own.
The sole production will occur after Canon Inc. buys the stake of Toshiba Corp. in their joint venture, SED Inc.
The companies are expected to make an official statement concerning their joint venture.
In order to start production of the new flat-screens based on the SED technology, Canon Inc. had to clarify the situation with the Texas-based Nano-Proprietary Inc.
The latter has brought a lawsuit against Canon in 2005 on the basis of the two sided agreement concerning the patent on SED technology.
The agreement didn't allow Canon to make any other ventures on this technology, but Canon joining forces with Toshiba was the reason for the mentioned lawsuit.
The dispute with Nano-Proprietary was the ground for Canon and Toshiba to delay the construction of the $1.7 billion plant for SED-based flat-panels.
Earlier the companies agreed to contribute with 100 billion yen each in the SED plant.
Toshiba's stake in the joint venture SED Inc. is about Yen$10 billion, or, approximately, US$83 million.
This new SED (surface-conduction electron-emitter display) technology is meant to replace the existing LCD and plasma screen due to their smaller sizes and lower energy consumption.
At the end of this year the companies planned to start mass production of these new displays.
Did we need to take a poll to find out how well America sleeps at night 
Probably not, but the results of the poll offer a worrisome picture about our problems getting a good nightâ€™s sleep.
The National Sleep Foundation, the poll sponsor, reports three-quarters of adults say they frequently have a sleep problem, such as waking during the night or snoring.
The average adult gets less than the recommended seven to nine hours of uninterrupted sleep each night.
This leads to poorer health, lower productivity on the job, more danger on the roads and a less vibrant sex life.
One-fourth admit their sleep problems do have an impact on their daily lives.
Becky Mcerien, 50, in Philadelphia, told a reporter By 3 to 4 in the afternoon, I'm starting to feel brain-drained and I need that caffeine to pick me back up again,
But Guillermo Sardina, 55, of Hamilton, N.J., said I sleep through the night.
Darwin McCallian, 51, of Burke, Va., rises at 4 a.m. to get a jump on traffic for his commute to Washington, DC.
When I sleep in a little bit longer, it makes me a safer driver, McCallian noted.
They recommend avoiding alcohol and caffeine close to bedtime, and that adults pay attention to how much sleep they get as well as the quality of that sleep, and seek help if needed.
A video has surfaced online that appears to show at least two Russian missiles flying out of control after the Lodeynoe Pole air force base caught fire in St Petersburg on May 23.
The video, which was broadcast by BBC News is about 45 seconds long and shows at least two out of control missiles being launched from within the base as the fire rages on and landing nearby.
No one was killed or injured when the missiles were set off, but witnesses report that several missiles were flying over their heads as they watched the blaze.
According to unnamed police officials investigating the fire, at least 400 to 450 air-to-air missiles were damaged or destroyed in the fire.
Officials estimate that the cost of the damage could exceed 80 to 100 million United States dollars.
We have yet to establish how many of them exploded and how many were damaged by fire, but in any case they can't be used, said an unnamed Russian official as quoted by the International Herald Tribune which quoted Interfax.
The base housed missiles and Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet planes.
Yesterday, in front of the USS Wisconsin in Norfolk, Virginia, presumptive Republican presidential nominee, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney selected Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his running mate.
After an introduction from Virginia governor Bob McDonnell, who himself had been considered a potential running mate, Romney officially made the announcement.
He referred to Ryan as an intellectual leader of the Republican Party and initially labeled Ryan as the next president of the United States before correcting himself after Ryan reached the podium.
Ryan, 42, has represented Wisconsin's 1st congressional district since 1999 and serves as chairman of the House Budget Committee.
Last year, he authored the budget proposal, The Path to Prosperity, which promotes reductions in federal spending of $6.2 trillion from the Obama plan through a repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a reformation of Medicare, and capping of federal discretionary spending.
During his acceptance speech, Ryan said that his record of getting things done in Congress will be a very helpful complement to Governor Romney's executive and private sector success outside of Washington.
He added that the campaign won't duck the tough issuesâ€”we will lead and went after the record of President Barack Obama, arguing that his policies didn't make things better.
On the announcement, senior Obama staffers explained that Ryan's selection makes clear that Romney would be a rubber stamp for the congressional GOP and that the choice provides the Obama campaign with clear advantages.
According to Reuters, Romney made the decision on August 1 after returning from his international trip.
Four days later, Ryan was secretly flown to Brookline, Massachusetts to meet Romney at the home of Beth Myers, who was running the vice presidential search.
Ryan was supposed to be announced on Friday in New Hampshire, but he had to return to Wisconsin to attend a memorial for victims of the 2012 Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting.
Thereafter, the campaign decided to make the announcement in Virginia, and so Ryan was once again secretly flown, this time to Elizabeth City, North Carolina near Norfolk, where he met with Romney and prepared his acceptance speech.
NBC News first announced the decision, and the Romney campaign announced the news to supporters through a phone application at seven a.m., a couple of hours before the official announcement.
NASA has announced that the Cassini spacecraft has found what seem to be geysers spewing water on the moon Enceladus.
The find raises the possibility of life on other planets, as liquid water is believed to be a requirement for life.
This marks the first time that scientists have seen evidence of water in liquid form so close to the surface on another body beyond Earth, said Cassini scientist Torrence Johnson.
Although life may be found on the moon, most scientists concede that if Enceladus does harbor life, it probably consists of microbes or other robust organisms capable of living in extreme conditions.
This latest discovery shows that life in other parts of the universe may be more probable than previously thought.
We realize that this is a radical conclusion â€” that we may have evidence for liquid water within a body so small and so cold, said Dr. Carolyn Porco, Cassini imaging team leader at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colorado.
However, if we are right, we have significantly broadened the diversity of solar system environments where we might possibly have conditions suitable for living organisms.
Irish budget airline Ryanair have dismissed pilot John Goss, who has worked with the airline for 25 years, over remarks he made in a documentary about safety at the airline.
Ryanair issued a statement confirming legal proceedings have been begun against Goss.
The airline is already suing the UK's Channel 4 over Monday night's broadcast of Secrets of the Cockpit, part of the Dispatches series, in which Goss appeared.
The programme discussed the airline's safety with a focus on fuel policy, investigating allegations Ryanair uses a bare minimum of fuel and intimidates pilots who raise concerns.
Goss, who had been due to retire in October, is a key figure of Ryanair Pilots Group (RPG), which conducted a survey of more than 1,000 flight crew.
According to the RPG survey almost 90% of respondents said the safety culture was nontransparent.
Ryanair had told pilots anybody signing a so-called safety petition might be dismissed.
Pilots interviewed for the programme said they felt pressured to save fuel, the cost of which has hit Ryanair's profits.
Following an incident in Spain in which three Ryanair flights declared fuel emergencies after being diverted to Valencia the Spanish Air Authority described Ryanair flights usually landing with a bare minimum of fuel, in a report the airline dismissed as manifestly inaccurate and factually untrue.
One anonymous pilot interviewed by Channel 4 accused the airline of threats and bullying.
Over 90% of those surveyed wanted a regulatory inquiry, with RPG saying the survey results were passed to the airline and the Irish Aviation Authority.
RPG is not recognised by the airline which calls the group [lacking] any independence, objectivity or reliability and a union front.
The other pilots interviewed by Channel 4 chose to remain anonymous, with only Goss identifying himself.
The airline says RPG only conducted their survey to unionise Ryanair pilots and issued a statement describing the documentary as based on nothing more than anonymous hearsay claims made by individuals whose identity was concealed, andor by representatives of pilot unions of Ryanair's competitor airlines masquerading as a non-Ryanair Pilot Group.
Ryanair claim Goss wrote to the airline saying he had no concerns about safety, stating We will not allow a Ryanair employee to defame our safety on national television just three weeks after he confirmed in writing to Ryanair that he had no concerns with safety and no reason to make any confidential safety report.
The airline further say they look forward to correcting Mr Goss's defamatory claims in court.
Channel 4 have previously stated an intent to defend the legal action against them.
The UN Security Council will mostly likely adopt a non-binding statement later today on North Korea's announcement of planned nuclear bomb tests; the statement does not explicitly mention the threat of sanctions.
This was announced by the Security Council president late yesterday.
Japan's UN envoy Kenzo Oshima, who chairs the 15-member body this month, said council experts made good progress in efforts to fine tune a Japanese draft, but said they had yet to finalize it.
Most likely we will have something adopted (Friday) once council members consult their respective capitals for final clearance, he added.
Earlier on Thursday, Japan and the United States pushed for a threat to resort to mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the UN Charter.
China and Russia (two veto members of the Council) however, voted against the sanctions.
It is hoped that the latest text will urge Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear tests and return back to six-party talks without precondition.
North Korea had earlier boycotted the talks in response to a sanction placed by the US on one of its banks, believed to linked to the regime of Kim Jong-Il.
North Korea claims it has nuclear weapons, although this has not yet been independently verified.
Political activist Ralph Nader has announced the launch of an independent campaign for President of the United States.
Nader, who also ran for president in the previous three elections, made the announcement on NBC's television program Meet the Press.
Dissent is the mother of ascent, and in that context I have decided to run for president, said Nader.
In the last few years, big money and the closing down of Washington against citizen groups prevent us from trying to improve our country.
And I want everybody to have the right and opportunity to improve their country.
In 2000, Nader ran for President as a Green Party candidate and received 2.7% of the popular vote.
Many Democrats believe his campaign led to the election of Republican George W. Bush by taking away potential votes for Democrat Al Gore, especially in the state of Florida.
Nader also ran in 2004 as an independent, but only garnered 0.4% of the vote.
At a press conference yesterday, Democratic candidate Barack Obama doubted that a potential Nader candidacy would have the same impact as in 2000.
I think the job of the Democratic Party is to be so compelling that a few percentage of the vote going to another candidate's not going to make any difference, he said.
He thought that there was no difference between Al Gore and George Bush and, eight years later, I think people realize that Ralph did not know what he was talking about, Obama told reporters.
Obviously itâ€™s not helpful to whoever our Democratic nominee is, she said.
I remember when he did this before, it didn't turn out too well for anyone, especially our country.
She said Nader prevented Al Gore from being the 'greenest' president we could have had, and she hoped his bid will be just a passing fancy that people won't take too seriously.
Nader dismissed criticism of his entry into the race, saying, For anybody who thinks that the third try is something that should be demeaned, it represents persistence, it represents never giving up the struggle for justice.
Meanwhile, Republican candidate Mike Huckabee welcomed Nader into the race, in the hopes that he will lessen the Democratic voter base.
I think it would always pull votes away from the Democrats, not the Republicans, he said.
So actually, Republicans would welcome his entry into the race and hope that a few more will join in.
A vote of no-confidence, to be held on Monday, is expected to signal an end to the current Canadian government.
The vote is to be held at 630PM local time in Ottawa, Ontario.
The no-confidence vote against Paul Martin's government was introduced by three of the opposition parties last week.
The actual motion was proposed by Conservative party leader, Stephen Harper.
Indonesia's High Court in Yogyakarta has overturned the April conviction of a Garuda Indonesia pilot who was behind the controls in an air disaster.
Captain Marwoto Komar was cleared of negligently causing the deaths of 21 when his Boeing 737 overshot the runway at Adisucipto Airport.
The March 2007 crash occurred after the flight from Jakarta landed at excessive speed and a steep angle.
The jet bounced down the runway before overshooting and coming to rest in a rice field, where it was destroyed by fire.
Of the 140 on board, sixteen Indonesians and five Australians were killed.
The court in Komar's trial had ruled that while it could not be shown for sure that the aircraft was mechanically sound with the Captain solely responsible for the dangerous landing, Komar had two minutes in which to inform air traffic control and his co-pilot Gagam Salman R. that they were experiencing an emergency.
The court found that had he done so Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting equipment could have been mobilised ready for the incoming jet.
The investigation by the National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) found no mechanical defect and stated that fifteen activations of the Ground proximity warning system had been ignored, but international law made this inadmissible as evidence.
The ruling was overturned in September, but has only just been published.
The High Court ruled that the prosecution had failed to legally and convincingly demonstrate guilt and therefore the defendant's rights, position and status should be restored.
Komar received half of the four year sentence sought by prosecutors but avoided jail as he was freed on bail while the appeal was pending.
Komar's lawyer Mochtar Zuhdi said the High Court decision was final and cannot be appealed.
The decision to charge Captain Komar was highly controversial; the first time Indonesia prosecuted a pilot over a crash.
Indonesia Air Traffic Controllers Association chief Adrie Gunawan said that 26 controllers left the country fearing possible prosecutions if anything went wrong on their shift; they also threatened to strike.
Indonesian Pilots' Association chief Manotar Napitupulu said This shows that the justice system has finally understood that Marwotoâ€™s case did not belong in court.
Last year Wikinews interviewed Paul McCarthy, an aviation lawyer and pilot who serves as the International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations' representative to the International Civil Aviation Organisation.
McCarthy said that prosecuting the man could have a chilling effect on people speaking to accident investigators, hence affecting safety.
Victims' families in Australia are upset and angry at the decision.
The Sydney Morning Herald used a headline that stated Ruling denies justice for Australian crash victims.
The fact he has had his conviction quashed and pilot status reinstated, it's like nothing's happened, said Caroline Mellish, whose brother Morgan was killed.
Simone Kerr, who lost her sister in the disaster, said My greatest fear is that he will be flying again.
Mahatma Gandhi's grandson, Arun Manilal Gandhi, was interviewed by Peter Sissons on behalf of BBC News 24.
Peter asked what Mahatma Gandhi would have done had he seen the Al-Qaeda problem.
Why don't all the Muslims, Christians and other religions have a day of fasting to show Al-Qaeda that we reject their philosophy, Arun Manilal Gandhi, founder of M.K. Gandhi Institute for Nonviolence, replied.
Heidi Hog turned inspiration into action launching [the] Fast for Freedom 8Â·8Â·8 campaign.
I maybe simplistic but sometimes its the simple things that need to be addressed, Heidi H. says.
Mike Wacht works in public relations and marketing, focusing on transportation and construction.
He is a member of the 511 Deployment Coalition and designer of Fast for Freedom 8Â·8Â·8 logo.
I want to reach the whole world and let the displaced and unfortunate know they are not forgotten.
It's been an inspiration and a small attempt to make a difference.
I've never tried to start a world-wide movement before, so I'm fumbling through with a little imagination and a lot of faith, said Mike W.
A worldwide fast on August 8, 2008 is proposed, beginning at midnight for a 24-hour period.
Fasting is practised in many religious traditions and spiritual practices.
The proposed day of action, August 8, 2008, has generated many supporters, according to Heidi H. and Mike W.
 There is a fresh buzz about encouraging people in a one-day peaceful fast from all nations to participate worldwide against war, famine, starvation, and aggressive secret governments.
United States Senator John McCain (R-AZ) has won the State of Florida's Republican Party primary election, edging out former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney by five percent (36 versus 31%).
With this win, Sen. McCain is now clearly the frontrunner going into next week's Super-Tuesday primaries.
One time GOP front-runner Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who placed a lagging third in Florida, the state he based his campaign on, dropped out of the race Wednesday, largely because he had no previous primary wins and dwindling support.
McCain was quoted saying I want to thank my dear friend, my dear friend Rudy Giuliani, who invested his heart and soul in this primary and who conducted himself with all the qualities of the exceptional American leader he truly is.
Democratic Senator and former First Lady Hillary Clinton, also from New York, won the Democratic primary in Florida; however, due to Democratic Party policy, the state has been stripped of its delegates.
Two CH-47 Chinook helicopters were called in on Wednesday, September 2nd, to help contain the wildfires on the Hawaiian Island of Molokai.
Smaller helicopters that were fighting the fire since it started around noon on August 29th were redeployed as well.
According to Gen Iinuma, Maui County Civil Defense administrator, the CH-47s carry 2000-gallon buckets of water, whereas the smaller helicopters only have 100-gallon buckets.
The Chinooks can dump more water in fewer trips than the smaller helicopters.
On the other hand, the tremendous downdraft from the bigger aircraft may make the fire worse.
If they don't do it right, they'll fan the fire, Iinuma said.
According to Iinuma, ground crews are continuing to maintain the fire's perimeter, which remained unchanged from Tuesday.
The helicopters are being used to fight the fires where ground crews can't reach, such as steep mountain passes and valleys.
Iinuma also expressed concern about a red flag advisory the National Weather service put out for all leeward areas of the Hawaiian Islands, meaning conditions are ripe for fires.
Lieutenant Governor James Duke Aiona, who took an aerial survey of Molokai's brush fire area, said it was no immediate threat.
He also noted that the fire seemed to come right up to the perimeter of some properties, but almost always stopped there.
Aiona's observations are mirrored by a local business owners' story.
The wildfires destroyed the beehives of Molokai Meli, a family-owned honey business in Kapaakea, but residents admit that the beehives were not their main concern.
We were just beating the edges with wet towels and sheets to try and keep it from getting to the houses that are just right over that ridge, said co-owner Brenda Kaneshiro.
All that metal right there, that's where they all were, there were 33 of them, said Elijah Kaneshiro, the owner's son.
A man was sentenced to three years probation after he and his mother argued about American Idol, a popular TV show in the U.S.
Cory Favreau hit his mother with a novelty bike chain in May after she expressed praise for last year's runner-up Katherine McPhee.
She was treated for a cut on her head and was released, police say.
Favreau, a twenty-five-year-old native of Plattsburgh, New York, pleaded guilty to third-degree assault.
He also pleaded guilty to a contempt charge for violating a court order to stay away from his mother.
20-year-old Kyle Flack, who came from Stanford-le-Hope in Essex, was deafblind and suffered from quadriplegia, cerebral palsy, and substantial learning difficulties.
He died in October 2006 after suffocating when his head became jammed in the railings around his hospital bed.
The trust admitted that health and safety breaches were a significant cause of his death, said Pascal Bates for the prosecution.
There had been significant errors in the hospital's systems and procedures, as the patient had not been properly supervised, training of staff was inadequate, information had not been passed on correctly, and warnings had not been heeded.
Bates told the court that the hospital had reached markedly short of the required standard, adding that [m]anagement failed to lay down correct procedures.
Earlier this year, Gill Flack, Kyle's mother, called for bosses of the hospital to be held personally responsible for this incident.
She described the hospital as the worst place for her child to have been cared for, saying that the standards of care there were absolute crap.
Syria's President Bashar al-Assad has rejected moves by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to negotiate, saying that he had no Israeli partner and not being serious about peace.
Ahead of talks with President Nicolas Sarkozy last Friday in Paris, he called upon France to be more involved in the Middle East peace process, after expressing disappointment with Barack Obama's performance and lack of action plan; in an interview with Le Figaro he called the United States the weak link.
Al-Assad said that he would not negotiate directly with Israel, but is willing to have discussions in Turkey.
If Mr Netanyahu is serious, he can send a team of experts, and we'll send a team of experts to Turkey.
Then we can really talk, if they're interested, he said.
There is a mediator, Turkey, which is ready to resume its mediation.
There is also French and European support for this process.
What we lack is an Israeli partner who is ready to go forward and ready to come to a result.
According to the BBC, France has been the major contributor in attempting to bring Syria back to diplomatic talks.
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner will attempt to stimulate talks in the Middle East between Israelis and Palestinians in the coming days.
Before talks with President Sarkozy, al-Assad had said France must act.
Since Israel's creation in 1948, Syria has been in a state of war with the country, having at no point recognized the existence of the state of Israel.
(See List of No Recognition of Israel) The major issues of conflict between the countries at present time concern Israel's possession of the Golan Heights region, annexed in 1981, and Syria's support for Hezbollah and Hamas.
The last direct talks between the two states collapsed in 2000.
Manuel Zelaya, the president of Honduras who was removed from power by the Honduran Supreme Court, has begun making his way back to his country.
Flying from Washington, Zelaya is to arrive in Honduran air space at around 2200 (GMT).
The former president had announced his willingness to return to his country, hoping for a reintegration.
Zelaya asked his people to be able to practice his rights peacefully after his arrival in the Central American country.
Nevertheless, the interim government that deposed Zelaya has announced that the flight would not be allowed to land.
Foreign Minister Enrique Ortez said I have ordered to not allow him to enter, whoever he comes with, to avoid the imprudence of allowing a president of the republic to die, of allowing a president of the republic to get hurt, of allowing a person to die.
Zelaya travels together with the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Miguel D'Escoto.
Other leaders of Latin America, who had promised to travel together with Zelaya, will instead monitor the development of events from El Salvador.
Among these leaders are the presidents Rafel Correa (Ecuador), Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner (Argentina) and Fernando Lugo (Paraguay), together with the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States (OAS), JosÃ© Miguel Insulza.
Zelaya's return takes place after the Organization of American States (OAS) voted in favour of suspending Honduras from the organization.
OAS resolved to suspend immediately the de facto Honduran government lead by Roberto Micheletti in accordance with the Inter-American Democratic Charter.
However, fear has aroused that Zelaya's return could trigger more violence.
The archbishop of Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, urged Zelaya not to return, fearing a possible bloodbath.
Fiji and New Zealand are engaged in a game of diplomatic tit-fot-tat after expelling each other's High Commissioners.
This afternoon Fiji's military regime expelled acting New Zealand High Commissioner to Fiji Caroline McDonald.
The New Zealand government retaliated by expelling Fiji's High Commissioner to Wellington, Ponsami Chetty.
Both will be given a week to leave the country.
McDonald's expulsion was announced late this afternoon by Fiji's interim Attorney-General Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, who said that it was a direct result of McDonald's actions over the past year that have been contrary to the accepted international norms of diplomatic behaviour.
The Fijian government has accused New Zealand and Australia of spying on Fiji, claiming they were tapping phone lines and listening in on members of the interim regime.
The New Zealand government has denied any misbehaviour by McDonald.
The round of diplomatic tit-for-tat was sparked by growing tensions between New Zealand and Fiji over sanctions put in place in the wake of the 2006 coup.
Members of the interim regime and their immediate families are barred from entering New Zealand.
Last week the Fijian regime threatened to expel New Zealand's High Commissioner unless the New Zealand government granted a visa to George Nacewa, the son of a senior regime official.
But yesterday the interim regime apparently backed down on its threat, issuing a statement that it would not expel McDonald and announcing that it would establish a special team to improve relations between the two countries.
McDonald is the second New Zealand diplomat expelled by Fiji.
In June 2007 then-New Zealand High Commissioner Michael Green was expelled after being accused of interfering in the country's domestic affairs.
Last week ONE News Pacific Correspondent Barbara Dreaver was deported as she arrived to cover the crisis.
Fiji's military overthrew the country's elected government in a military coup in December 2006.
The mother of Brazilian soccer player Luis Fabiano has been kidnapped.
The police are not giving too many details, and a great part of local media is not reporting the case, afraid of putting the life of Fabiano's mother at risk.
On November 6, 2004, the mother of Robson dos Santos, or Robinho, was kidnapped.
In both cases, the hostages were released and they are well, and the police arrested the suspects.
A building in Iran's capital Tehran collapsed today and killed at least 19 people.
The victims were all labourers living inside the building, which is reported to have been in a seriously unstable condition for a month, with occupants refusing to comply with evacuation requests.
The early morning disaster in the Sa'adatabad district reduced the building to rubble in seconds.
The seven story building was described by The Canadian Press as 'dilapidated'.
Five people have been arrested, including the owner and contractors.
Iranian state media promised that those responsible would be dealt with severely.
A Russian teenager has accomplished an unprecedented feat in the history of world aviation.
He flew a distance of 1,300 kilometres in a wheel well of a Boeing 737 and lived.
The fifteen year old Andrey Scherbakov spent two hours in the wheel well of the airplane at extreme temperature of âˆ’50Â° centigrade.
The rear wheels do not go all the way into the plane; the wheel merely retracts into an opening and remains exposed.
The boy managed to bypass security at the Perm city airport to hide in the plane as it took off.
Airport workers found the boy after the plane had landed at Moscow.
The boy was delivered to the hospital by the airport staff and is said to be in a critical condition.
His arms and legs were so severely frozen and swollen that the rescuers were not able to remove his coat and shoes.
There is a probability that his hands may have to be amputated.
However, according to the medical staff at the hospital, it is nothing short of a miracle that the boy survived the ordeal.
The Boeing 737 has a cruising speed of 900 kilometres per hour and was flying constantly at an altitude of 10,000 metres for two hours.
As a result, the boy suffered severe frostbite in both of his hands.
Doctors in Ural city would have to remove his fingertips, which contracted gangrene after they had frozen, but they were committed to do everything within their power to stop it from spreading.
When Scherbakov finally came to his senses, he told the police that he had run away from his family so as to escape his alcoholic father.
He said that he was wandering around the territory of the airport and noticed a hole in the fence.
He fell asleep during his examination of the stowaway of the plane.
It is curious how the inspection staff and the technicians found nothing on their inspection of the aircraft just before the flight.
The boy claims that he fainted soon after and came around only when the plane had landed in Moscow after traveling hundreds of kilometres from Perm.
However, Moscow's air and water transport control department said that the claim was true.
A department spokesperson said that the incident happened on Friday, and the boy's parents were immediately informed and flew into the capital on the same day.
Stowaways in wheel wells risk freezing to death after take-off or being crushed when the wheels retract.
This year, a body was found in the wheel well of a jet in San Francisco after a flight from Shanghai and another body was found in Atlanta after a flight from Dakar, Senegal.
Zork Hun is running for the Libertarian party in the Ontario provincial election, in the Parkdale-High Park riding.
Wikinews' Nick Moreau interviewed him regarding his values, his experience, and his campaign.
Stay tuned for further interviews; every candidate from every party is eligible, and will be contacted.
Expect interviews from Liberals, Progressive Conservatives, New Democratic Party members, Ontario Greens, as well as members from the Family Coalition, Freedom, Communist, Libertarian, and Confederation of Regions parties, as well as independents.
Services were slowly restored after an unscheduled strike by SNCF drivers closed one of Paris's six main railway stations.
Gare Saint-Lazare was closed from 10 am local time on Tuesday morning.
Members of the Sud Rail labour union later voted to return to work, and the station re-opened at 7 pm the same day.
Gare Saint-Lazare is Europe's third busiest station, and its lines serve Paris suburbs, as well as inter-city routes to Normandy in northern France.
In a move aimed to prevent fines stemming from its antitrust lawsuit filed by the European Commission (EC), Microsoft announced that it will be releasing portions of the source code to its Windows operating system.
The EC ruled in March 2004 that Microsoft had abused its position in the low-end server and media player market, and required that Microsoft disclose complete and accurate interface documentation which would allow non-Microsoft work group servers to achieve full interoperability with Windows PCs and servers.
Microsoft reacted by making available 12,000 pages of technical documentation and up to 500 hours of technical support, but the EC came to the conclusion that it was not enough.
Announcing that we are putting our most valuable intellectual property on the table so we can put technical compliance issues to rest, Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith asserted that Microsoft would be superseding the EC's requirements as a sign of good faith.
While we are confident that we are presently in full compliance with the Decision, we wish to dispel any notion that Microsoftâ€™s technical documents are insufficient, said Smith.
The EC responded in a memo that it will study Microsoft's reply to the Statement of Objections once it receives the full details.
However, EC Competition Commissioner spokesman Jonathan Todd commented that it would be premature to conclude access to the source code would resolve the problem of the lack of compliance with our decision.
A similar offer was made by Microsoft in August 2002 during its antitrust lawsuit filed by the United States Department of Justice and several states' Attorneys General.
The resulting Microsoft Communications Protocols Program had suffered continuous criticism regarding excessive cost, paperwork, and non-disclosure agreements.
It is unclear at this time if Microsoft's planned Work Group Server Protocol Program will suffer from the same issues if accepted by the EC.
Microsoft is expected to return to the EC courts in April.
Two days before Tom Cruise An Unauthorized Biography, a biography of actor Tom Cruise written by journalist Andrew Morton, was released in the United States, a video showing Cruise promoting Scientology was leaked to the Internet.
The promotional video appeared on video-sharing sites including YouTube, Gawker.com and radar online.com, and clips from the video were also shown on Wednesday morning talk shows in the United States.
In the 9-minute video produced by the Church of Scientology, Cruise is seen discussing his beliefs while the theme from his Mission Impossible films plays as background music.
Cruise appears wearing a black turtleneck sweater, speaking about his dedication to changing people's lives.
The format of the video appears to be an interview with Cruise, and it is edited with questions cut out.
Throughout the video, Cruise uses Scientology jargon terms such as KSW For me, itâ€™s all about KSW.
The term stands for Keeping Scientology Working, which refers to a 10-point letter written by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard in 1965 to ensure the organization's survival.
Cruise also discusses SPs, or Suppressive Persons, PTSPs, a potential trouble source influenced by a Suppressive Person, and the need to confront and shatter suppression.
Cruise makes assertions about programs which use Hubbard's teachings such as Criminon and Narconon We're the authorities on getting people off drugs.
Of the manner in which he wishes to spread Scientology's message, he says You're in the playing field or out of the arena.
The video concludes with Cruise laughing, and then a voiceover says Scientology can be defined by a single question would you want others to develop the knowledge you have
 In answering that question, Tom Cruise has introduced LRH [L. Ron Hubbard] technology to more than 1 billion people on earth.
And that is only the first wave he has unleashed.
That is why the story of Tom Cruise, Scientologist, has only just begun.
According to Reuters, the Church of Scientology stated that the video was shown at a 2004 meeting of the International Association of Scientologists.
In a statement, the Church of Scientology said that the video was Cruise's acceptance speech after he had been given the organization's Freedom Medal, and was shown before an audience of 5,000 church parishioners and their guests.
The statement also called the video that appeared on the Internet a pirated and edited version.
A representative for Cruise confirmed the Church of Scientology statement The video is of Mr. Cruise making an acceptance speech to fellow parishioners at a private church event in 2004.
David Miscavige, head of the Church of Scientology, had presented Cruise with the Freedom Medal of Valor at the 2004 ceremony.
Eighty Scientologists have received the Freedom Medal since the award's establishment in 1985, but Cruise is the only recipient of the Freedom Medal of Valor.
Andrew Morton's Tom Cruise An Unauthorized Biography characterizes Cruise as the second most powerful individual within the organization.
The video first appeared on the Internet on Sunday, and disappeared after the footage was linked to from Gawker.com and The Huffington Post.
Gawker.com posted a copy of the video Tuesday morning, and said that the video had been passed around privately by reporters and writers investigating Cruise's ties to Scientology.
Gawker.com noted that a smaller video clip which had previously been available on YouTube is no longer available, most likely after the Church of Scientology sent in a copyright infringement notice.
Gawker.com has stated that the video will stay up on its site, and has reprinted correspondence with Ava Paquette, an attorney with Moxon & Kobrin, a law firm representing the Church of Scientology.
Nick Denton of Gawker.com commented on the posting of the video It's newsworthy, and we will not be removing it.
Investigative journalist Mark Ebner is helping to post more than two hours of additional footage related to the Cruise video, and called it the most unintentionally hilarious footage you've ever seen, and characterized it as better than when Cruise jumped on Oprah's couch during a May 23, 2005 appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, and the South Park parody of Cruise in the controversial episode Trapped in the Closet.
Ebner appeared on The Today Show on Wednesday, and discussed the video's appearance on the Internet.
In response, the Church of Scientology called Ebner a fraud.
Ebner told the New York Daily News that These tapes were made for purposes of recruitment.
Attempts by the Church of Scientology to stop distribution of the video via the Internet seem to have backfired spectacularly, according to The Press Association, and by Thursday the video was viewable on websites other than Gawker.com, including the New York Post, Independent Television News and the BBC.
For websites based in Britain usage of the video is protected under copyright laws, specifically for reporting news and current affairs.
Still other reports on the video linked to locations where it could be watched, including a report in The Times.
Copies of the video were not available on Google Video on Thursday, but were still available on YouTube.
Attorney Mark Stephens of London-based firm Finers Stephens Innocent commented on the Church of Scientology's attempts to remove the video from the Internet The Scientologists, by taking action to enforce their copyrights, have made it a news story.
The mistake was not to foresee that a news story has special protection in copyright law in reporting news and current events.
Yousuf Raza Gilani, the prime minister of Pakistan, has told British prime minister Gordon Brown that Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden is not in the country.
Brown hailed Pakistan's efforts to disrupt the activities of al-Qaeda, and referred to them as his allies, promising to provide another Â£50 million to support the operations to stabilise the borders of the nation; announcing this pledge, he said This is your fight but it is also Britain's fight.
Gilani said in a press conference today I doubt the information which you are giving is correct because I don't think Osama Bin Laden is in Pakistan.
He argues that the intelligence provided by the United States is not credible or actionable, and requested more clarity from the US before he could act on it.
He said that Pakistani officials are carefully examining Barack Obama's new Afghanistan plan, which he announced yesterday, before making a decision on whether or not to support it.
The month long election campaign in the run up to this weekend's elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo has ended, with a one day break before voting can begin Sunday.
The fiercely fought campaign began on June 29th and involved no less than 9,707 parliamentary candidates and 33 presidential candidates.
Canvassing ended yesterday with a mass rally in support of the current president Joseph Kabila.
Kabila, who became the youngest head of state in Africa in 2001, used his final speech before voting to claim credit for taking the D.R.Congo to its first democratic elections in over 40 years.
I can say to you without false modesty mission accomplished he told crowds of around 50,000 on Friday, We've reunited and pacified the country.
It is also a message of hope, and for peace and development and security after the polls.
The international community is taking a keen interest in the elections â€” the first since 1961.
However, the July campaign has been marred by violence and accusations of fraud on all sides.
International observers, such as the Carter Centre, expressed concern that the incumbent President's domination of the media would undermine the campaign.
Several hundred people protested at alleged irregularities in the polls on the 18th of July, which ended in 7 people being killed in police clashes.
This Thursday, 6 people were killed in election related incidents in the capital, Kinshasa, and yesterday, Kabila's presidential guards killed an opposition candidate's bodyguard in a gunfight.
50,000 polling stations have been set up around the country, for the 25.6 million voters, with over 60,000 Congolese police and 1,700 international observers in place to monitor voting.
Argentina reached their first ever World Cup semi-final with a 19-13 victory over Scotland in the quarter-final stage of the 2007 Rugby World Cup at the Stade de France, Saint-Denis, France.
Scotland took the lead with a penalty from Dan Parks.
However Felipe Contepomi kicked two penalties as Argentina moved ahead, before Gonzalo Longo ElÃ­a added a try to extend their lead.
Chris Paterson responded with a penalty just before half time, but Argentina went into the interval leading 13-6.
Argentina extended their lead further after the break with a third penalty from Felipe Contepomi and a drop goal from Juan MartÃ­n HernÃ¡ndez.
Chris Cusiter scored a try for Scotland with seventeen minutes remaining, but they could not make a breakthrough as Argentina held on to win.
South Africa, who defeated Fiji earlier today, await Argentina in the semi-finals.
Manchester United and Watford met Saturday at the neutral ground of Villa Park for the semi-final of the FA Cup.
Both teams went into the game on highs, as United had thrashed Roma 7-1 during the week, and Watford had defeated Portsmouth 4-2 in the Premiership.
With that confidence boost for Watford boss Adrian Boothroyd, Watford sported an attacking lineup with Hameur Bouazza and Tamas Priskin as strikers.
United's recent injury troubles allowed Alan Smith to play as strike partner to Wayne Rooney with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on the bench.
The first chance in the match fell to United, and the Red Devils capitalized.
A long ball by Carrick was left by both Smith and Giggs before it came to Rooney, and he cut inside before blasting a shot high to the right of Richard Lee, giving United an early lead.
Watford were not dispirited by the early goal, and soon began to create chances through set pieces.
A flailing boot by a Watford player in the area connected with Edwin Van Der Sar's recently healed nose, and the big Dutch keeper had to have splints put in before play could continue.
Watford took advantage of the stoppage to catch their breath, and scored as soon as play resumed when Hameur Bouazza's side footed volley caught Van Der Sar unaware, and crept in off the crossbar after deflecting off Gabriel Heinze.
United's response was nearly instant, as Smith's pass into Rooney released him on the right.
After Lee nearly blocked a pass into Ronaldo, the Portuguese winger was able to bobble the ball home, scoring his twenty-first goal of the season, and restoring United's lead.
Gavin Mahon then had a chance to equalize again for Watford, but his side footed volley was saved by Van Der Sar.
Ronaldo then had a chance for his second as he was released by Rooney, but a last ditch tackle by DeMerit kept the scoreline at 2-1.
A groin injury for United's Rio Ferdinand then forced Alex Ferguson to replace him with Darren Fletcher, a move which saw a shuffle in the entire back line.
Rooney then had a chance for a brace, but his hard shot was palmed away by Lee.
Watford started the second half strongly with Bouazza nearly scoring off a long throw, but his side footed effort went just wide.
Alan Smith then set up Rooney's second goal of the match as his curling cross was easily deflected in by Rooney's left foot.
Cristiano Ronaldo was then replaced with Kieran Richardson, and the substitute made nearly an instant impact, scoring United's fourth goal of the afternoon.
A well timed pass by Smith was met by the sprinting Richardson, and he easily chipped the ball over Lee and into the back of the net to secure a place in the final for United.
Relegation bound Watford will meet Blackburn in the Premiership next, while United have a league game of their own at Old Trafford against Sheffield United.
A final report released today by the Indonesian National Transport Safety Committee found that Adam Air Flight 574 crashed because the pilots were distracted by an instrument failure.
The loss of the budget carrier's Boeing 737 into the sea near Sulawesi on New Year's Day 2007 left all 102 on board missing and presumed dead.
The report found that the 737, registered PK-KKW, suffered a Inertial Reference System (IRS) failure.
While pilots were troubleshooting for this navigational system they first unintentionally disconnected the autopilot, then failed to monitor other instruments informing them they were approaching the sea, crashing into it and destroying the aircraft.
The flight had been a scheduled domestic passenger service between Djuanda Airport at Surabaya and Sam Ratulangi Airport at Manado, and disappeared from radar screens at 35,000 feet.
National Transportation Safety Committee head Tatang Kurniadi told a press conference This accident resulted from a combination of factors including the failure of the pilots to adequately monitor the flight instruments, especially in the last two minutes of the flight.
Preoccupation with a malfunction of the Inertial Reference System diverted both pilot's attention from the flight instruments and allowed the increasing descent and bank angle to unnoticed...
The Cockpit Voice recorder revealed that both pilots were concerned about navigation problems and subsequently become engrossed with trouble shooting Inertial Reference System (IRS) anomalies for at least the last 13 minutes of the flight, with minimal regard to other flight requirements.
He also supplied a number of statistics concerning the final moments of the flight.
Whilst in a right bank with sustained elevator input pushing up the nose the aircraft reached Mach 0.926 and 3.5g.
The airspeed had reached 490 KCAS by the end of the recording.
Investigator Santoso Sayogo said that the high speed impact caused the plane to disintegrate.
In 2006 another B737 suffered a navigational problem and flew into a radar blackspot, leaving it lost for several hours before performing an emergency landing hundreds of miles from the intended destination.
Sayogo said today that in the three months preceding the accident the airline had registered 154 defects in PK-KKW's navigational equipment.
The crash, coupled with Adam Air Flight 172, which snapped in half during a hard landing, and Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, which overshot the runway in Yogyakarta, killing 21, prompted the European Union to add all Indonesia's airlines to the list of air carriers banned in the EU.
Earlier this month another Adam Air flight departed the end of a runway during landing, injuring five and damaging the plane.
This prompted the authorities to ground Adam Air for three months after a regular evaluation, after which they may be permanently shut down.
Nine people were killed and 31 were injured after a car bomb blew up in the city of Falluja in western Iraq, local officials said.
This is the second bomb blast in the Anbar province within the past few days.
Six people were killed after a suicide bomber detonated explosives at a funeral in Haditha on Monday.
Security forces are still looking for victims under the rubble, said the head of the Amiriya local municipal council, Shaker al-Issawi.
According to reports from witnesses, the blast was so strong that it threw bodies onto rooftops of neighbouring buildings.
Unlike previous such explosions, this explosion did not appear to be set by a suicide bomber.
A witness near where the car bomb exploded said that a man had parked a blue truck, and left it a quarter of an hour before it exploded.
The British rail regulator has announced new train services for the country's premier line.
New open access (unregulated and non-franchised) company Grand Northern is to be given space (known in the industry as paths) to run three train services a day between London King's Cross and Bradford, Halifax, Wakefield and Pontefract in West Yorkshire.
Grand Northern's sister open access company Grand Central was given an extra path to increase services between King's Cross and Sunderland.
The existing franchisee of the line, National Express East Coast, was given the right to run services to London from Harrogate, Lincoln and Bradford, but not provided with paths unless the government changes the contracts of the other franchises whose territory these services would cross.
Two other potential open access providers had their plans rejected by the regulator.
First Group's Hull Trains had wanted to start a new service, Harrogate Trains, to run from North Yorkshire to London, whilst Platinum Trains had sought paths from London to Aberdeen in Scotland.
Britain's state-owned national railway company British Rail was controversially split-up and privatized in stages between 1993 and 1997.
It was replaced by a series of privately owned regional train franchises for set periods, several unfranchised open access services and a track control and maintenance company.
A local Swiss government has shown some bare cheek and has taken action, after hordes of German naked hikers rambling across the Swiss alps au naturel, caused indignation amongst locals.
Authorities in Swiss canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden have warned that starting from February 9, the government will impose hefty fines of 200 Swiss Francs (Â£122, â‚¬135) on naturists found walking or hiking in the nude without clothes in the picturesque mountains because of a recent influx of visiting German nudists.
The new ordinance is expected to be passed this spring.
If it is approved by the local parliament on February 9 it should be effective on April 26.
The Swiss canton aims to stop spread of 'indecent practice' by minimally-clad German climbers.
The problem started with a group of boot-only hikers who were stopped by the police in the Alpine region last autumn.
They had wandered there regularly, proudly marching through nature with bare bums, and had also advertised what they thought was a naked paradise on the internet.
A nude rambler dressed in nothing more than a rucksack and walking boots in the eastern Appenzell region was arrested and detained in the canton, but authorities were unable to file lawsuit because the act was not punished by law or ordinance at the time.
We were forced to introduce the legislation against this indecent practice before the warm weather starts, Melchior Looser, the cantonâ€™s justice and police minister, said.
â€œUltimately, in the summer lots of kids stay in our mountains,â€ he added.
In the guidelines imposed, arrested offenders who cannot pay the fine, will face legal action.
The new enabling ordinance has, however, been met with protests by nude hikers.
It's the most harmless pursuit possible, said Dietmar, age 58, a German lawyer.
German tabloid Bild Zeitung has editorially attacked Swiss intolerance and even suggested nudist alternatives worldwide, after hinting a Swiss tourism boycott.
Local authorities of Harz mountain range in central Germany have also announced the openness to any visitor of an â€œofficial naked walking routeâ€ in nature's outdoors.
The naked ramblers have hoped it doesn't lead to another naturist-clothed 'war', like the one at a beach between German and Polish holidaymakers in 2008.
Naturism has roots traced from the start of the 20th century.
Abandoning unpractical clothes enables a direct contact with the wind, sun and temperature, naked hiker website nacktwandern.de stated.
The local people are upset and we in the government share their concern.
How would one feel if one was to go walking in nature and suddenly came across a group of naked people 
They are definitely not people from the area, and I think many of them come from Germany,â€ he noted.
I can understand that we all have to live in this world together, said Barbara Foley, International Naturist Foundation member of the central committee.
But I would certainly enjoy doing the hike in the nude and I wouldn't want to be deprived of it.
Maybe they should designate a couple of trails and people would know they might come across naturists there, she added.
Appenzell Innerrhoden (Appenzell Inner Rhodes) is the smallest canton of Switzerland by population and the second smallest by area, Basel-City having less area.
The population of the canton was 15,471 as of 2007, of which 1,510 (or 9.76%) were foreigners.
The canton in the north east of Switzerland has an area is 173 kmÂ².
It was divided in 1597 for religious reasons from the former canton Appenzell, with Appenzell Ausserrhoden being the other half.
Most of the canton is pastoral, this despite being mountainous.
Cattle breeding and dairy farming are the main agricultural activities Appenzeller cheese is widely available throughout Switzerland.
Due to the split of Appenzell along religious lines, the population (as of 2000) is nearly all Roman Catholic (81%), with a small Protestant minority (10%).
The town, however is far from liberalism the canton granted women the right of suffrage only in 1990 under pressure from the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland and international human rights groups.
The Alpine village of Appenzell Innerrhoden, being known for its beautiful landscape, has recently been declared a naked rambler paradise by a German mountaineering website, which was created by a lobby group of hikers.
An ethical controversy has surged in the United States and elsewhere around nine-year-old Ashley X (her family name has not been released).
The disabled girl was operated upon at the request of her parents, to prevent her from growing, menstruating and developing breasts.
The parents, who wish to remain anonymous, explain their situation on a blog entitled The Ashley Treatment.
There have been over 1000 reactions on the blog so far.
Ashley suffers a condition termed static encephalopathy with marked global developmental deficits of unknown etiology, which means brain damage of unknown cause leading to a kind of static condition.
She can make sounds, move her arms and kick her legs, but she cannot change her position, eat, walk, talk etc.
Many of these children are in poor health and die young, but Ashley is in good health.
For all of these functions she depends on her caregivers.
Most of the day she passes watching her surrounding, lying on a pillow.
Her parents call her their Pillow Angel, since she is so sweet and stays right where we place herâ€”usually on a pillow.
Ashley's parents want to keep her at home and care for her themselves, and they want to guarantee their daughter's quality of life.
To this end, they say, Ashley underwent several surgical procedures and medical treatments during a period of three years.
To attenuate her growth, Ashley was given high doses of the hormone estrogen.
Ashley now measures 4ft 5 (1m 35cm) and weighs around 75 lbs (34 kg), which is below her expected length and weight.
Her low body weight and size would improve her comfort, and at the same time facilitate the work of her caregivers.
Surgery to remove her uterus (a procedure called a hysterectomy) and breast buds were performed, so Ashley does not menstruate and will not develop breasts, both of which parents think only would cause her discomfort.
Since high estrogen levels can cause menstrual bleeding and breast development, the surgery was also meant to limit these effects.
She also underwent surgery to remove her appendix, because it would be difficult to diagnose appendicitis given Ashley's low communication possibilities.
Leader of the Federal Opposition in Australia Tony Abbott has made claims Thursday during Question Time in parliament that a 'people's revolt' is looming based on the Prime Minister Julia Gillard's proposal for a 2012 carbon tax.
In what Mr. Abbott describes as a betrayal of the Australian people, Ms. Gillard announced Thursday that a price for carbon will be put back on the national agenda, for several years, to be followed by the formation of an emissions trading scheme.
In the lead up to the 2010 Federal Australian Election, Ms. Gillard claimed that while she might implement a green house gas reduction scheme, [she would] rule out a carbon tax.
The price on carbon will be applied to industrial and transport emissions but will not, however, affect Australia's agriculture.
The Prime Minister's announcement resulted in a large portion of Question Time being devoted to the issue with a Member of the Opposition being expelled from the House for disorderly conduct.
Mr. Abbot then moved to censure the Prime Minister and conclude Question Time claiming Nothing is more fake than making a promise to the Australian people before the election and breaking it after the election â€¦
I don't believe it's going to happen because I think there will be a people's revolt.
They will see this as an assault on their standard of living, which is exactly what it is.
To which the Prime Minister responded Increasingly Australians understand that the Liberal Party, under the Leader of the Opposition, is a party of the past with no real policies or plans for the nation's future â€¦
You get judged ultimately in this Parliament by what you decide to do and what you deliver, and on this side of the Parliament we are determined that from July 1 (2012) we will price carbon.
The Opposition claims that the proposed carbon tax will cause petrol prices to rise by A$0.065 per litre while energy bills may increase by $300 per year.
Police apprehended a 18 inch tall monkey that is reported to have bitten a 20 year-old woman outside State Street Brats, a Madison, Wisconsin nightclub.
The long-tailed, black and white monkey, which was wearing a diaper, was leashed in a beer garden outside the nightclub on State Street when people began to pet the animal.
When the woman approached the monkey around 100 a.m. CDT (UTC-5) on Wednesday morning and put her hand out to pet it, it bit her then escaped the garden and led police on a seven hour 'monkey hunt' before it was caught.
The woman was left with four puncture wounds to her thumb.
Doctors are said to be testing blood samples from the monkey to check for diseases.
This guy was in the beer garden at State Street Brats letting women pet his monkey, said a spokesman for the Madison police Department, Joel DeSpain.
Police say the monkey will remain in quarantine for at least ten days.
Irish Senator Kieran Phelan has died suddenly at the age of 60.
Phelan died after falling ill in his hotel in Dublin this morning, shortly before a meeting due to be held by the Seanad.
Phelan sat on the Industrial and Commercial Panel and had been a Senator since 2002.
He was also a Laois County councillor and was elected council chairman in 1998.
He is a constituency colleague of mine and a lifelong friend.
As a mark of respect, Leader of the House Donie Cassidy proposed that the house be adjourned until June 1st.
New Orleans police shot eight armed gunmen on the Danziger Bridge, according to a police statement, after contractors crossing the bridge came under fire.
The police claim they shot at eight people carrying guns on the bridge.
This comes as Mayor Robin Nagin began to turn the city over to state and federal control.
The fourteen contractors were en route to launch barges into Lake Pontchartrain in order to fix the break in the 17th Street Canal when, according to police, the gunmen opened fire on the group.
Deputy Police Chief W.J. Riley said police shot at eight people carrying guns, killing five or six.
However, according to foreign sources, the five killed were contractors for the Army.
In a unrelated incident, a civilian helicopter crashed near the Danziger Bridge.
The two passengers on board escaped with only minor cuts and scrapes.
The Danziger Bridge spans a canal which connects Lake Pontchartrain and the Mississippi River.
Jean ChrÃ©tien, one of Canada's former prime ministers, received quadruple heart bypass surgery yesterday at Montreal's Heart Institute.
He's well and he's recuperating very well at the moment.
His outcome is excellent, said Chief of surgery, Dr. Michel Pellerin.
He could have risked his life as he was diagnosed with unstable angina.
It is caused by obstructed arteries, which causes heart pain in a person's body.
The golfer told him to see a doctor as soon as possible.
He had a bit of discomfort and mentioned it because there was a doctor there, said a friend of ChrÃ©tien, Eddie Goldenberg.
The doctor asked him a couple of questions and said, 'You better come and see me.'
He had to postpone his speech at the Asia-Pacific mining conference in Vancouver, B.C..
Peter Dunne's proposition as the leader of the New Zealand political party, United Future, to have Waitangi Day changed back to New Zealand Day failed.
The New Zealand Day bill would have created disharmony within the society according to parliamentary select committee, the Justice and Electoral Committee.
But they do say that it could be a good idea for a completely new holiday to be created called New Zealand Day.
I welcome the advice from the committee that many of the submitters were in favour of retaining Waitangi Day and having another day set aside for a national day that will celebrate everything that's good about New Zealand and being a New Zealander, said Mr Dunne.
Mr Dunne said the reason for his proposed change was because since New Zealand is multi-cultural, then New Zealand's national day should be one about everybody and not one about grievance.
Mr Dunne says that he is still backing New Zealand Day in some form despite the rejection, as he is now considering many options, including changing the Queen's Official Birthday holiday to New Zealand Day, and starting Dominion Day back up.
He says that he is now considering writing up a new bill to submit it to the New Zealand Parliament.
Waitangi day is on February 6, each year and celebrates the Waitangi signing of New Zealand's founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi).
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez stated the U.S. government may have planned the September 11, 2001 attacks.
He said the attacks have been used to justify U.S. aggression throughout the Middle East and also that 911 conspiracy theories are plausible.
Chavez said in a speech Tuesday, The hypothesis is not absurd ... that those towers could have been dynamited.
He also said A building never collapses like that, unless it's with an implosion.
The U.S. government has maintained that Al-Qaeda orchestrated the attacks under the leadership of Osama bin Laden.
At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, after four days of negotiations, Africa countries have made the first draft version of future possible treaty, to replace the 1997 Kyoto protocol.
Africa leaders demand 5% of GDP of developed world citizens to be given as a finance to developing countries for struggle with global warming.
Along with this, developing countries expect rich countries to increase their emissions cuts goals.
Funding for developed countries was previously expected to be 130 billion US dollars.
The new proposal is about 11 times larger, according to 2008 GDP estimates.
In an interview in Copenhagen, Chinaâ€™s representative Su Wei commented, The developed countries need to speed up the process and come forward with more ambitious targets by 2020.
Many nations offered emissions cuts pledges, which vary from 4% to 17% cuts by 2020, compared with 1990 levels.
The Africa's draft proposes a goal of 65% cut for every developed country.
Though the new goals are harder, Anders Turesson, European Union representative at UNCCC, doubted in the ability of them to prevent 2-degree warming.
In an interview in Copenhagen, he said, We are concerned about the environmental integrity of these texts and we do not see how they will deliver the 2-degree target.
Hopefully we will be able to step up our ambitions as we move forward in the negotiations.
British Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband criticised the draft text for absence of a certain temperature raise threshold, said that the new texts are shorter texts than weâ€™ve had before, which we can negotiate around because the imperative here is to get on with it and get to an ambitious solution.
Bloomberg news company interviewed several people from New York environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).
Its policy director David Doniger expects most difficulties to come at the end of the UNCCC, when Barack Obama and Wen Jiabao arrive at the summit Itâ€™s really come down to a set of difficult 
Itâ€™s a lot easier for lower-level negotiators to come to an impasse and go home.
Itâ€™s not easy for senior officials and definitely not easy for heads of government.
As international climate policy director of NRDC Jake Schmidt commented similarly, Itâ€™s going to be a tense negotiation over emissions cuts for developed countries.
Zinedine Zidane has apologised on French TV for his actions on the World Cup final, Wednesday - but the apology did not extend to his victim.
Zidane had headbutted Italian player Marco Materazzi and was sent off after 110 minutes play.
But on French television Zidane showed remorse for his behaviour.
I want to ask for forgiveness from all the children who watched, he said.
It was expected that Zidane would reveal what provoked him into the headbutt.
However, Zidane refused to divulge what Materazzi actually said but did say that Materazzi made remarks which were very personal and specifically concerned his mother and sister.
Materazzi had earlier admitted that he insulted Zidane, but denied any remarks on Zidane's mother or having made a racial slur.
I lost my mother when I was 15 years old and still get emotional when I talk about it.
Zidane is my hero and I have always admired him a lot, said Materazzi.
While the French star's comments contradicted Materazzi's view Zidane also refused to apologise to Materazzi for his on-field assault.
I want to apologise to them [the children] but I can't regret what I did because it would mean that he [Materazzi] was right to say what he said.
The partial apology comes as FIFA President Sept Blatter said Zidane may be stripped of his Golden Ball award for the tournament's best player.
FIFA set up a disciplinary committee to investigate Zidane's violent conduct.
After the red card to Zidane, Italy went on to win the final on penalty kicks.
U.S. Senator Barack Obama's family name may sound similar to that of the given name of Osama bin Laden.
According to prominent American left-wing online blog Daily Kos, which was the first to report it, CNN mixed the two up on Monday, leading into a segment on bin Laden with the title, Where's Obama on The Situation Room, a show hosted by pundit Wolf Blitzer.
Soledad O'Brien and Blitzer apologised separately during CNN's American Morning on Tuesday.
We want to apologize for that bad typo, Mr Blitzer said.
We also want to apologize personally to Senator Barack Obama.
I'm going to be making a call to him later this morning to offer my personal apology.
He also added that he appreciated the online blogs who brought the error to light.
Though I'd note that the 's' and 'b' keys aren't all that close to each other, I assume it was just an unfortunate mistake, and don't think there was any truly malicious intent, said Tommy Vietor, Obama's press secretary.
The government of Canada is fighting to keep Washington from having access to passenger lists for Canada's domestic flights.
The Canadian transport minister Jean Lapierre said two-thirds of Canada's domestic flights at some point cross through American air space.
The Minister said he may have to re-route them (around U.S. airspace) rather than breach the privacy rights of domestic Canadian passengers.
In plans which are not yet finalized, Washington recently warned Canada (and other countries) the U.S. intends to require that its no-fly list procedures apply to all foreign airlines which pass through U.S. airspace.
After 911, a watch list of suspected terrorists was created by the U.S. that bars those on the list from air travel within its borders.
On Wednesday, Lapierre said it's a â€œvery hot issue,â€ and that heâ€™s working to protect the privacy of Canadians.
We donâ€™t think itâ€™s a good idea that Canadians travelling from one (Canadian) city to another would have to be checked under the American no-fly list.â€ Lapierre said.
He estimates that nearly two-thirds of the 278,000 yearly flights between Canadian cities cross over the U.S. border.
Most major flight zones from urban centers in Canada are in its southern portion, close to the U.S. where even winds might push a plane across the border.
If the matter can not be resolved, Lapierre said, â€œWe would have to take a northern route, which would be much more expensive.â€ 
Yahoo! News Canada reports that Lapierre intends to lobby U.S. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta against the changes.
Last year, the Canadian province of British Columbia put controls on firms that handle an individual's personal data that prevents them from sharing private information on Canadians with U.S. authorities.
The issue goes to Canada's sovereignty of its citizens and the U.S. sovereignty of its airspace.
The historically close relations between Canada and the U.S. was evident during the recent Virgin Atlantic incident, where a flight was intercepted by 2 Canadian CF-18 jet fighters.
They were scrambled from Quebec to escort the inter-continental flight originating from London to the Halifax International Airport after a hijacking signal, an apparent accident, was sent from the plane.
The plane was detained in Halifax on Friday for approximately four hours.
Ultimately it was cleared, and landed safely at its original destination in John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City.
Both the ACLU and the Electronic Privacy Information Center are involved in lawsuits against the U.S. government relating to no-fly lists.
EPIC has received documents under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act which it says establish that the TSA administers two lists a no-fly list and a selectee list, which requires the passenger to go through additional security measures.
The names are provided to air carriers through Security Directives or Emergency Amendments and are stored in their computer systems so that an individual with a name that matches the list can be flagged when getting a boarding pass.
A no-fly match requires the agent to call a law enforcement officer to detain and question the passenger.
In the case of a Selectee, an S or special mark is printed on their boarding pass and the person receives additional screening at security.
PepsiCo Inc. is in line to get its first female chief executive before the end of the year.
Steven S. Reinemund, chairman and CEO of the U.S. soft drink and snack food giant, announced his retirement via press release effective in May, 2007.
Reinemund, 58, said he was leaving to spend more time with his family.
The same PepsiCo release confirmed that Indra Nooyi, currently president and CFO, will take over for Reinemund.
The first is scheduled to be filled by Richard Goodman, 57, currently CFO of PepsiCo International, who will become CFO.
Hugh Johnston, 44, currently senior vice president of transformation, was promoted to the newly created post of executive vice president of operations, procurement and information technology.
Nooyi, 50, is a Yale-educated daughter of a middle class Indian family, according to her official biography.
She is scheduled to succeed Reinemund, in October, the company said.
Together, Nooyi and Reinemund have guided PepsiCo through several large take-overs and has seen the company overtake The Coca-Cola Company both in terms of sales and market value.
Coca-Cola is still the No. 1 soft drink maker based on U.S. and global market share.
A significant portion of PepsiCo's sales revenue comes from non-drink brands in its Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats product lines.
Some on Wall Street were surprised by Reinemund's retirement announcement, according to news reports.
Monday, the stock (tickerPEP) closed up $0.62 at $63.95 per share on the NYSE.
The Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization which maintains data on hate groups, has described Alamo's organization as a cult.
The Ross Institute Internet Archives for the Study of Destructive Cults, Controversial Groups and Movements maintains a web page on Tony Alamo and his organization.
AP reported that many former members of Alamo's organization also characterize the Tony Alamo Christian Ministries as a cult.
Anna Pugh, a former member of the organization for 11 years, recounted some of her experiences in what she referred to as Tony's Cult to KOCO-TV.
She stated that while she was living at Alamo's compound she felt she was brainwashed.
Pugh says that while she was a member of the group a seven-year-old girl took her aside and told her Alamo had sexual conduct with minors while watching pornography.
I think that congregation in there needs to see what that man is.
He is a very unmerciful, malicious, vindictive, judgemental, condemning person, said Pugh.
Former member Anthony Lane told KSLA-TV he was kicked out of Tony Alamo Christian Ministries when he questioned some of Alamo's teachings.
He is definitely a man who arranges marriages of little girls, and orders beatings of little children, said Lane.
He has been getting help from a support group called Partnered against Cult Activities (PACA).
Lane is trying to gain custody of his three children who are still in the group with his wife.
Alamo was convicted of tax evasion in 1994, and was released from prison in 1998 after serving four years out of a six year sentence.
The Internal Revenue Service said Alamo owed the U.S. government US$7.9 million.
Prosecutors in the tax evasion case argued prior to Alamo's sentencing that he was a flight risk, and a polygamist who conducted inappropriate activities with women and girls in his organization.
The Tony Alamo Christian Ministry organization promotes a philosophy and belief system which asserts sex with underage girls and polygamy is acceptable.
The organization is critical of Catholicism, homosexuality, and the government.
Tony Alamo Christian Ministry has compounds in Arkansas, California, Georgia and New Jersey, and Alamo himself lives near Los Angeles.
A researcher at the University of Oxford has found a saucy poem attributed to John Milton, the 17th-century poet who wrote Paradise Lost and other religious verse.
An Extempore Upon a Faggot, discovered in an 18th-century anthology of poetry, is not thought by modern scholars to be by Milton, however, and may in fact have been written by one of his rivals in an attempt to disgrace him.
The poem was found by Dr Jennifer Batt, who said that it is so out of tune with the rest of his work, that if the attribution is correct, it would prompt a major revision of our ideas about Milton.
She discovered the rude verse in the Harding Collection of poetry anthologies held by the Bodleian Library, the main university library at Oxford.
To see the name of John Milton, the great religious and political polemicist, attached to such a bawdy epigram, is extremely surprising to say the least, she added.
The book in question, the Oxford and Cambridge Miscellany from 1708 (over 30 years after Milton's death), was described by another Oxford academic, Dr Abigail Williams, as a set of poems written by witty young men about town for witty young men about town.
Milton wrote in blank verse rather than using rhyme and used differing poetic rhythms, whereas the handwritten poem uses a simple pattern of rhyming couplets as it contrasts the sexual behaviour of young women and more experienced women by comparing them to green wood and dry wood upon a fire.
Have you not in a Chimney seen 
A Faggot which is moist and green
 How coyly it receives the Heat
 And at both ends do's weep and sweat 
 So fares it with a tender Maid
 When first upon her Back she's laid 
But like dry Wood th' experienced Dame
 Cracks and rejoices in the Flame
Milton (1608â€“1674) wrote many influential religious poems, including Paradise Lost, which is described by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography as widely and rightly regarded as the supreme poetic achievement in the English language, fit to sit alongside the poems of Homer, Virgil, and Dante.
It tells the story of the fall from grace of Adam and Eve in an epic theological poem.
He followed it with Paradise Regained, depicting the temptations of Jesus in the wilderness.
Bawdy poetry is not thought by modern academics to be in keeping with Milton's style, with Batt suggesting that it is likely that his name was added to the poem to bring scandal upon [him], perhaps by a jealous contemporary.
She suggests that the culprit might have been Sir John Suckling, a poet who was a supporter of the monarchy, in contrast to the Republican Milton.
The University of Oxford is currently digitising the songbooks and anthologies of the Harding Collection, said to be the world's largest such collection, as part of a project to allow online access.
It is named after Walter Harding, a British musician who collected music and poetry in Chicago.
The poem had been read before, but without anyone noticing Milton's name at the bottom.
Dr Williams, the project's leader, expressed her doubts as to the authenticity of the attribution, commenting that [y]ou could become very rich and famous â€“ well, famous, anyway â€“ if you could prove the rhyme was really by Milton.
Edward Natapei, the Prime Minister of Vanuatu has lost his position and parliamentary seat over a paper work blunder.
Natapei was in Trinidad and Tobago at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and his staff failed to file the paperwork that notified the parliamentary speaker of his absence.
Under Vanuatu law, since he missed three consecutive sittings of parliament without notifying the speaker in writing, he must forfeit his seat.
In order to comply with the law, Natapei would have needed to submit a signed explanation for his absence to the speaker.
The last time a similar event occurred was in the 1980s when a Member of Parliament lost his job for failure to notify the speaker of his absence.
Natapei is now on his way back from Trinidad and Tobago.
The nation is currently being run by a caretaker government.
Members of Parliament are set to vote for a new Prime Minister next week.
Natapei was elected Prime Minister on September 22, 2008, as President of the socialist, Anglophone Vanua'aku Pati party.
After 14 months in office, he now holds the record for the shortest term as prime minister in Vanuatu's history.
On Monday, Australian telecommunications company Telstra has introduced dual carrier HSPA+ standard for broadband Internet business customers in the Next G network.
This is the first time this technology is being introduced on national scale.
The bandwidths the users can deploy increased into two to three times, with Telstra becoming the worldâ€™s fastest national mobile broadband service.
The switch started with enabling the service for premium users.
On Sunday two separate suicide bombing attacks killed up to 31 people.
The first attack took place when a police-army convoy was hit by two roadside bombs in the mountainous region near the Pakistani-Afghani border.
The second bombing took place when a suicide bomber detonated in front of a police headquarters in Dera Ismail Kha killing 17 police recruits who were taking a test to join the local police force.
Since the Red Mosque siege began there have been 67 people killed in bombing and shooting in Pakistan.
On Saturday 24 soldiers were killed when a suicide bomber crashed into two army vehicles in the town of Swat along the Afghani border.
In that attack three civilians were killed 39 people were wounded most of them critically.
According to reports, at least eighteen people were killed in Brazil in the past 24 hours, following heavy storms that led to mudslides and torrential rains.
Most of the deaths occurred in the Rio de Janeiro area of the country, and the local Office of Civil Defense commented that more deaths are likely as the inclement weather continues.
The deaths were caused mainly because some shanty-houses collapsed under rain or mud.
After an oil pipeline in China exploded and spilled around 1,500 tonnes of oil into the Yellow Sea near the city of Dalian, the government has launched a cleanup operation consisting of more than 800 vessels.
The spill occurred on Friday, after a pipeline at the port exploded.
The oil terminal at the port has been closed ever since.
Authorities have been using 24 ships designed for cleaning up oil, and today ordered around 800 civilian fishing boats to join the operation.
The spill has been halted, although an oil slick which measured 50 square kilometers at its height remains in the harbor, and ships are using absorbent foam to remove oil from the water, as well as barriers to keep oil from reaching the shore.
Despite their efforts, parts of the coast reportedly have a slick of oil evident on beaches and rocks.
Although rough seas have affected the cleanup, authorities expect to have completed the operations within ten days.
According to domestic media, concerns over safety at the port have been raised in the past; a government study in 2006 noted that five projects at the port were at risk of accidents.
The spill has caused ongoing disruptions to the port's operations, with several ships, including six oil tankers carrying a total of around twelve million barrels of oil, having been diverted to other ports both in China and other countries.
Australia has defeated New Zealand by 44 runs in the one off Twenty20 international match at Eden Park.
This victory, in the first full international Twenty20 match, gave Australia a unique treble having won the first ever test match and then the first ever limited overs international.
Batting first, Australia set a total of 214, with Australian captain Ricky Ponting top scoring with 98 runs from 55 balls, including 8 fours and 5 sixes.
New Zealand's Kyle Mills led the bowling attack with 3 for 44.
Scott Styris top scored for New Zealand with 66 runs from 39 balls.
Australian paceman Michael Kasprowicz finished the match with figures of 4 for 29 from his 4 overs.
The New Zealand team had dressed in the 1980s beige uniform for the occasion.
Many had also grown facial hair suiting the 1980s for the match.
The teams now go on to play a one-day series followed by a test match series.
Snow has fallen in Baghdad, Iraq for the first time in approximately 100 years.
Although Baghdad sometimes sees hail and sleet, snow has never been seen in living memory.
Snow was also recorded in the western and central parts of the country, where it is also very unusual, and in the Kurdish north, which is mountainous and commonly sees snowfall.
A statement by the meteorology department read Snow has fallen in Baghdad for the first time in about a century as a result of two air flows meeting.
The first one was cold and dry and the second one was warm and humid.
Dawood Shakir, director of the meteorology department, told AFP his take on the causation of the snow It's very rare.
These snowfalls are linked to the climate change that is happening everywhere.
We are finding some places in the world which are warm and are supposed to be cold.
Temperatures in some parts of the country fell below freezing, compared to winters that are normally mild in a climate that sees summer temperatures of 120 degrees Fahrenheit.
Snow fell in the capital city from prior to dawn until just after 9 a.m. local time.
The flakes failed to provide a covering of snow, instead melting quickly.
However, many local people still had positive things to say about the once in a lifetime event.
Mohammed Abdul-Hussein, a 63-year-old in retirement, commented For the first time in my life I saw a snow-rain like this falling in Baghdad.
When I was young, I heard from my father that such rain had fallen in the early '40s on the outskirts of northern Baghdad but snow falling in Baghdad in such a magnificent scene was beyond my imagination.
Fawzi Karim, who runs a small restaurant in Hawr Rajab, six miles from Baghdad said I asked my mother, who is 80, whether she'd ever seen snow in Iraq before, and her answer was noâ€¦
This is so unusual, and I don't know whether or not it's a lesson from God, while college student Talib Haider said a friend of mine called me at 8 a.m. to wake me up and tell me that the sky is raining snow.
I rushed quickly to the balcony to see a very beautiful scene.
I tried to film it with my cell phone camera.
I called my other friends and the morning turned out to be a very happy one in my life.
Resident Aysar Khaled told Reuters I woke up and I saw snow falling, so I woke up all the family and told them to come and see the snowfall.
Everyone in Baghdad is delighted because this is a new thing, this is the first time that it snows in Baghdadâ€¦
Some viewed it as a sign of impending peace, or at least of an improving situation in the war-torn country.
Hassan Zahar, a 60-year-old resident, said It is the first time we've seen snow in Baghdad.
I looked at the faces of all the people, they were astonishedâ€¦
I invite all the people to enjoy peace, because the snow means peace.
The snow was a new sign of the new Iraq, according to traffic policeman Murtadha Fadhil, who spoke to Reuters whilst sheltering under a balcony.
We hope Iraqis will purify their hearts and politicians will work for the prosperity of all Iraqis.
There are no reports of any bloodshed during the time the snow was falling.
According to Forbes annual World's Billionaire list released yesterday, Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim is the world's richest person for the second year in a row, with a net worth of US$74 billion.
American Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft Corp, is again listed in second place with US$56 billion while investor Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway is third.
China added the most new billionaires to the list with 54 while Russia added 31.
The US came in third, with 23 new billionaires; American Mark Zuckerberg, chairman of Facebook, more than tripled his net worth to US$13.5 billion, placing him in Forbes' 52nd spot.
Although the US is home to 413 billionaires, more than any other country, the changing distribution of global finances is evident.
Today, due to the increasing wealth of emerging nations, just one in every three billionaires is American, a decline from ten years ago when Americans numbered one in every two.
Brazil, Russia, India and China together accounted for more than 108 new billionaires.
Last year, New York was home to more billionaires than any other city in the world, while this year Moscow is home to 79, which beats New York's current number of 58.
Forbes lists a world total of 1,210 billionaires whose combined wealth is US$4.5 trillion, an increase from last year's total of US$3.6 trillion.
Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra arrived today in Cambodia where he will take up a post as the government's economic advisor.
The appointment has caused a diplomatic incident between the two countries, as Shinawatra was condemned to two years in jail in absentia for corruption.
Tension is already mounting, with the Thai government expressing both anger and embarrassment over the appointment.
They have withdrawn their ambassador and have decided to cancel plans with the Cambodian government for trade and oil exploration.
This comes amidst disputes over the Preah Vihear temple complex which spans both countries.
Thailand has further threatened to close borders with its neighbour.
Thaksin will address 300 Cambodian economics experts on Thursday in Phnom Penh and is expected to remain two or three days according to Cambodian cabinet spokesman Phay Siphan.
It is an honour for Cambodia's economic sector and we hope that Cambodians nationwide welcome him warmly, he announced.
We are looking forward to learning from Thaksin's great economic experience and we are convinced that his experience will contribute to our country's economic development, he said.
A coup in 2006 ousted Thaksin after members of parliament defected during military rule.
Since then he has been in exile, mostly living in Dubai.
He is still influential in Thailand, using protests by the Red Shirts, and the Thai government fears that Thaksin will use Cambodia as base to campaign.
However, Thaksin published a letter on his website on Monday indicating that he did not intend to go to Cambodia to help Cambodia fight with Thailand [...]
As I travel to Cambodia to discuss poverty and the world economic situation, I will try to preserve Thai interests with our friends in Phnom Penh, despite the Thai government still hounding me wherever I go, he stated.
A Canadian NATO soldier was killed today in Afghanistan by a bomb while on patrol in Panjwaii district, west of Kandahar on foot.
Military officials have not yet released the name of the soldier.
His remains were taken by a helicopter to the Kandahar Airfield.
One soldier from Hamilton, Ontario was reported to have suffered minor hearing loss as a result of the blast.
Earlier today at 12 p.m., there was a rally called Red Friday for the Canadian troops in Afghanistan held in the Younge-Dundas Square in Toronto, Ontario.
Many in Toronto wore red in support for the troops.
It was announced at the rally that the Canadian soldier was killed by a bomb.

Dark Floors, a horror film under production in Northern Finland and starring the hard rock band Lordi (who are famed for their monster costumes and lyrical themes), has received â‚¬300,000 (Â£200,000) funding from the Finnish government.
Lordi are also famed for their record-breaking 292 point victory in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 with their song Hard Rock Hallelujah.
It was also the first time a hard rock song had won the contest, and Finland's first ever victory.
The film is being shot in English, with a largely Finnish cast, and has a production cost of â‚¬4.2 million (Â£2.84 million).
The plot features a monster attack on the world, with a young Autistic girl being the only person in a position to save it.
Lead singer Mr Lordi said that as their masks and costumes were derived from horror films it was kind of natural that they should make their own.
According to a French journalist and the imam of the local mosque, around 400 people have been killed in the riots that erupted due to a dispute in the result of the local elections.
The riots are taking place in the Nigerian city of Jos, which is located between the Christian and Muslim areas of Nigeria.
The elections which sparked the violence, did, according to a rumor spread around the city, result in the predominantly Christian People's Democratic Party beating the All Nigerian Peoples Party, a predominantly Muslim party.
Khaled Abubakar, the imam of the city's central mosque, made an estimate of the death toll.
So far about 400 bodies have been brought to the mosque following the outbreak of violence, he stated.
Families are coming to identify and claim the bodies, while those that cannot be identified or are not claimed by anybody will be interred by the mosque.
A French journalist confirmed the reports of Abubakar, despite the fact that early reports showed only twenty deaths.
Yakumu Pam, a Christian clergyman in Jos, also commented on the chaos.
Hundreds of people have been killed in the last two days since the riots started, he stated.
Remains of burned bodies litter some parts of the town.
In an effort to stop the fighting, the army has been ordered to open fire on people, and to create a buffer zone between the Christians and the Muslims.
Umaru Yar'Adua, the President of Nigeria, has stated that he is very sad about the ongoing violence.
Scott McClellan, a former White House Press Secretary, says in a new book that George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and Karl Rove, misled McClellan about the Plame leak, leading him to publicly exonerate Rove and Lewis Scooter Libby.
And five of the highest ranking officials in the administration were involved in my doing so Rove, Libby, the vice president, the president's chief of staff, and the president himself, says McClellan in a excerpt of the book that was released to the public.
In an interview with CNN, earlier this year, McClellan said his statements were what he believed to be true at the time based on assurances that we were both given.
At that time he gave no indication that Bush was involved with or even knew that Rove or Libby were involved with the leak.
The current White House Press Secretary, Dana Perino, said, when asked about it today, that it is not clear what McClellan means in the excerpt.
The President has not and would not ask his spokespeople to pass on false information, she said.
Just when you think the credibility of this White House can't get any lower, another shoe drops, said Senator Chuck Schumer, of New York.
If the Bush administration won't even tell the truth to its official spokesman, how can the American people expect to be told the truth either
Cindy Sheehan, the grieving mother of a fallen soldier in Iraq, has gained national attention for her efforts to demand the President of the United States speak with her personally.
What I want to ask is, 'What noble cause did my son die for'
And if he says that it was to get rid of Saddam or liberate the Iraqi people, I'm not going to buy it.
Prompted by President George W. Bush's announcement that Americans in Iraq have died for a 'noble cause', Sheehan has been camping near Bush's Texas ranch for the past week to demand a private conversation with the President.
I don't want comfort, she told Cox Newspapers, I want the truth.
Mr. Bush said he was aware of the pleas of the grieving mothers, But whether it be here or in Washington or anywhere else, there's somebody who has got something to say to the President, that's part of the job.
And I think it's important for me to be thoughtful and sensitive to those who have got something to say.
But I think it's also important for me to go on with my life, to keep a balanced life.
Cindy has been joined in Crawford by hundreds of supporters, including many other mothers of fallen soldiers, who are camping out with her and joining her in calling for the truth about why their sons had to die.
Rallies of support are also taking place and being scheduled across the nation, and contributions from citizens across the world are flowing into the Peace House, a nearby cottage providing shelter and support for the mothers.
Casey's grandparents and other members of her extended family issued a statement emailed to the Drudge Report website, which reveals their disagreement with the actions and statements that Mrs. Sheehan has made and accuses her of using her son's death to promote a personal agenda
The Sheehan Family lost our beloved Casey in the Iraq War and we have been silently, respectfully grieving.
We do not agree with the political motivations and publicity tactics of Cindy Sheehan.
She now appears to be promoting her own personal agenda and notoriety at the expense of her son's good name and reputation.
The rest of the Sheehan Family supports the troops, our country, and our President, silently, with prayer and respect.
Mrs. Sheehan has responded by saying that political views within her extended family have always been diverse, but she is happy that her husband and children share her views and are supporting her efforts.
She says her husband Pat, couldn't bear having Casey's things at home and put most of them in storage.
Mrs. Sheehan and her husband were part of a group that met with the President following her son's death last year; a meeting that President Bush began with what she thought was an insultingly insensitive greeting; Who we'all gonna honor today.
Mrs. Sheehan says she had mixed feelings about Bush's demeanor at the meeting, but kept quiet.
When more information came out about the planning for the war, however, she started to feel utterly betrayed.
I want the kind of meeting that holds him accountable for the words he's actually said., Sheehan told Time magazine reporters.
The UK Secretary of State for Defence John Reid has admitted the withdrawal of 5,500 of the 8,500 British troops in Iraq by spring 2006 is a possibility.
It comes after a report was leaked to the Mail on Sunday in the aftermath of the 7 July London bombings.
The document (Options for Future UK Force Posture in Iraq) was marked Secret - UK eyes only and also contained information on possible U.S. troop reductions, bringing the number of Coalition forces in Iraq down to 66,000.
About 176,000 Coalition troops are presently in Iraq, 130,000 of which are from the United States Armed Forces.
However, the document also reveals there is division between the Pentagon, which apparently favours a relatively bold reduction, and U.S. commanders in Iraq who are more cautious.
The British Army is the lead component of the Multi-National Division (South-East).
It has maintained forces in the 8,000+ region since the end of the 2003 Iraq War.
In the document, Mr Reid admitted that a large reduction of British and U.S. forces would make it difficult for other countries to keep their force in Iraq.
Mr Reid, who took up the position of Secretary of State for Defence on 6 May 2005, admitted that the document was made by him for Prime Minister Tony Blair.
In the document, Mr Reid stated that a decision would need to be made later this year on British forces levels in Iraq.
The possible transfer of control of Al Muthanna and Maysan provinces, followed by Al Basrah and Dhi Qar provinces in 2006, were also included in the document.
It estimated the reduction of British forces could save about Â£1 billion pounds (about $1.7 billion U.S. dollars).
In a statement on 10 July made in response to the leaking of the document, Mr Reid denied that the document signalled any change in policy, stating that, No decisions on the future force posture of UK forces have been taken.
But we have always said that it is our intention to hand over the lead in fighting terrorists to Iraqi security forces as their capability increases.
We therefore continually produce papers outlining possible options and contingencies.
On 4 July, during a debate in the House of Commons, Mr Reid had hinted at possible reductions in forces, saying that, By and large, about 12 [of 18] of the provinces are relatively free of terrorist attacks.
As the Iraqi forces become trained to take the lead, it is possible, over a period of time, to hand the lead role to Iraqi forces in certain areas of the country and gradually, we hope, over the whole country.
A spokesperson of the MND (SE) was questioned by a Wikireporter.
When asked whether speculation of reductions would affect British forces morale in Iraq, it was insisted that, The British forces will continue to operate in the professional manner to which they always have done.
The spokesperson added, No decision on the future posture of UK forces in Iraq has been taken.
Assisting the Iraqis to improve the security environment remains our top priority.
Speaking of the response by Iraqis to the London bombings, the spokesperson said, Most of the feed back from Friday pray[ers] in the British Area of Operation were against the attacks on London.
April 7, 2005 ABC News anchorman Peter Jennings was diagnosed this week with lung cancer.
Despite beginning out-patient treatment next week which will involve chemotherapy, Jennings will continue to front ABC's 'World News Tonight' show, to the extent he can do so comfortably, says ABC News.
Almost 10 million Americans are living with cancer, Jennings told ABC staff on Tuesday.
I am sure I will learn from them how to cope with the facts of life that none of us anticipated.
The 66-year-old anchor man, who gave up smoking several years ago, added I hope it goes without saying that a journalist who doesn't value deeply the audience's loyalty should be in another line of work.
Jennings began his career at ABC News in 1964 and in 1983 was made senior editor and anchor of World News Tonight.
Due to ill health, he was unable to work during his network's special report on the recent death of Pope John Paul II.
Pakistani officials have said that a suicide bomber struck a crowded market today in northwest Pakistan, killing an anti-Taliban mayor.
At least eleven other people were killed in the blast, and dozens were wounded.
Initially, Mayor Abdul Malik was reported to have survived the attack in the Matni area on the outskirts of the city of Peshawar.
The market was crowded with shoppers ahead of the Muslim festival of Eid.
Officials said that Malik, a former Taliban supporter, had switched sides and raised a militia to fight the Taliban.
He had survived several attempts on his life since shifting his allegiance.
Malik had survived several attacks on his life in the recent past, since he turned against the militants, said the top Peshawar official, Sahibzada Anis.
The Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) reported today a significant explosive event had occurred at Mount Redoubt in Alaska.
Lightning was observed within an ash cloud that formed over the volcano.
As a result the AVO raised the alert level to 'warning' and level 'red' for aviation.
According to the Observatory, seismic activity caused a major lahar, similar to a mudslide or landslide, to occur in the Drift River Valley.
Inhabitants of the Valley were advised to seek high ground and take immediate precautions against flooding.
So far there are no reports of injuries or evacuations.
Wikinews has e-mailed the AVO for a statement regarding the event, but has yet to receive a reply.
Strong, but diminishing seismic activity is continuing as of 0735 AKDT, said the AVO on its website.
At 918 a.m., the AVO reported that the event had ended.
Continuing seismic activity and web camera images indicate that low level emissions of steam, gas, and some volcanic ash are continuing to be emitted at the volcano at altitudes of [20,000 feet].
The AVO is sending a team to investigate the latest eruption which will include a fly-over to take readings on the gases being emitted.
The explosion sent volcanic ash which spread to Homer, Anchor Point, and Seldovia to an altitude of over 50,000 feet.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued an advisory stating that ash fall can be expected from Ninilchik Southward through mid morning.
The advisory is scheduled to end at 1000 a.m. (AKDT).
As a result of recent eruptions at Redoubt, half of the 6 million gallons of crude oil stored in the Drift Valley will be removed to a safer location.
There is no word on when the move will take place.
The storage facility is located just 22 miles from Redoubt.
Two recent polls have shown that the residents of the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, England would prefer to live in Scotland.
Located 57 miles from Edinburgh, Scotland and over 300 miles from London, Berwick was a frequent bone of contention in the border wars between the independent kingdoms of England and Scotland, changing hands at least 13 times between 1147 and 1482.
Under the Treaty of Perpetual Peace agreed in 1502 by the English King Henry VII and the Scottish King James IV, Berwick was declared to be of the Kingdom of England but not in it.
This resulted in Berwick having to be named individually in legislation until the British Parliament passed the Wales and Berwick Act in 1746 which stated that unless specially specified otherwise, the term England in laws included Berwick and Wales; in 1853 the declaration of war on Russia specifically mentioned Berwick, but the 1856 Treaty of Paris did not, leading to the urban legend that the town was still at war with Russia until the Mayor signed a peace treaty with a Soviet diplomat in 1966.
Since the creation of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, Berwickers have noted that Scottish residents receive about Â£1500 more government expenditure each year than English residents, including free care for elderly people and free university tuition, both of which have to be paid for in England.
The town already has a strong Scottish influence - famously both its football team and rugby team play in the Scottish leagues, a minority of the town's banks are Scottish, and the Church of Scotland has a large congregation in the town.
A poll conducted for the ITV television programme, Tonight, to be broadcast on February 18 has shown that 60% (1,182 for, 775 against) of those polled would prefer the town to be in Scotland, while a poll for The Berwick Advertiser newspaper showed 78% in favour.
This has resulted in a motion being proposed by Scottish National Party MSP Christine Grahame, calling on the Scottish Government to negotiate for Berwick's restoration to Scotland.
A spokesman for Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said The Scottish Government has no territorial demands on our friends in England.
But it's clear most people in Berwick would rather be part of SNP-governed Scotland than Labour-run England.
Vodafone McLaren Mercedes driver Heikki Kovalainen won the FIA Formula One 2008 ING Magyar NagydÃ­j at the Hungaroring, Budapest, Hungary on Sunday.
It was the first Grand Prix win of Kovalainen's driving career and he became the 100th winner in Formula One history.
Ferrari driver Felipe Massa had dominated the race since the start when he overtook both McLaren front line sitters - first Kovalainen and then Lewis Hamilton.
During the first part of the race, Hamilton punctured his front tyre and lost more positions as well as his hopes of winning.
It seemed that Ferrari had the race in the pocket, but on the dying laps, Massa's engine was consumed by fire and he stopped on the main straight.
Kovalainen took the opportunity to rush to the finish line.
Timo Glock did a brilliant job for his Toyota team, taking the second place.
He qualified in fifth place and was in third until Massa went out.
The race became the first podium finish for Timo Glock, too.
Still, his position was in danger from Kimi RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen, who was racing close to Timo, but slowed down to secure his third place.

Gabriel Amorth, the Roman Catholic Church's leading exorcist, has suggested missing schoolgirl Emanuela Orlandi was kidnapped for sexual abuse at orgies attended by foreign diplomats and arranged by Vatican police.
Amorth, 85, who was appointed by the late Pope John Paul II, makes his remarks as Italian police try to determine if bones buried near the body of a mobster belong to Orlandi.
Anonymous claims have suggested the tomb of contains clues to her disappearance.
Investigators are examining bones removed from his burial site in the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare.
Buried in a nearby crypt, the bones are thought to be centuries old but forensic tests are ongoing.
One theory is Pedis kidnapped Orlandi to press Vatican officials over a financial dispute, with his onetime lover claiming her body was disposed of in a cement mixer.
Amorth refutes this explanation, and also an alleged international dimension; another theory is that the kidnapping was to try and secure freedom for Mehmet Ali Agca of Turkey, who shot at the pope in 1981.
Orlandi's vanishing was a crime with a sexual motive says Amorth.
He further told La Stampa The network involved diplomatic personnel from a foreign embassy to the Holy See.
Orlandi has not been seen since she set off from the family apartment in the Vatican City, heading for a Rome music lesson.
Amorth is a controversial priest who lays claim to thousands of exorcisms and has criticised activities such as yoga and children reading books as spiritually harmful.
Two men were hanged Iran on Thursday, following their conviction for playing a role in the bombing of a Shiraz mosque, which killed thirteen people, last April.
After the June election, which was widely disputed, there were several weeks of demonstrations and protests, which saw 4,000 people arrested by the authorities in a crackdown, among them journalists and reformist politicians.
Opposition groups asserted that the elections were rigged to favour president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, but the government denied it, saying it was a foreign-backed attempt to discredit the Iranian government system.
Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi has said that Nigeria should be divided into two separate nations to avoid further violence between Muslims and Christians.
He was quoted as saying that the spilt would stop the bloodshed and burning of places of worship.
During his speech to students, Gaddafi spoke about the partition of India.
He called that division a historic, radical solution which saved the lives of millions of Hindus and Muslims, despite reports that one million people were killed.
He also called the recent violence in Jos a deep conflict of a religious nature, and put the blame on the British stating that the federal state was imposed by Britain.
Around 100 people have died already this year in violence near the city of Jos.
A senior Nigerian diplomat responded to Gaddafi's comments saying that he did not take the suggestion seriously.
Patsy Calton from Bramhall, Cheshire, England, a Liberal Democrat MP for the Cheadle constituency died at age 56 from cancer on Sunday May 29.
The Liberal Democrat party leader Charles Kennedy described her as a spirited and courageous politician.
She was first elected to the Cheadle constituency by the slim margin of 33 votes in the 2001 election.
She was then re-elected just 24 days before her death with a greatly increased majority of 4020, in spite of not campaigning herself due to the illness.

She is survived by her husband Clive Calton, who worked as her researcher at the House of Commons, and her son and two daughters.
Talks between the European Union Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Chinese Commerce Minister Bo Xilai, held today in Beijing, brought no compromise on unblocking 80 milion pieces of Chinese textiles impounded in the EU.
The clothing is held in European warehouses due to overshoot of the China-to-the-EU export quotas.
In June, the EU member states agreed to raise the limit by approximately 10%, but EU importers and Chinese producers continue to push for a greater amount of trade.
Concerns on textiles imported from Asia have split the EU countries those with strong retail sector support increasing the quotas, while others, which have large clothing industries (Spain, Portugal, Italy) want to keep, or even reduce, limits in the future.
A similar dispute exists between China and the United States.
On Friday, George W. Bush's administration announced new quotas on imports of Chinese bras and synthetic fabric, after negotiations between both countries broke down.
Bill Gwatney, chairman of the Democratic Party of Arkansas, died this afternoon at 359 pm CDT (UTC-5) after having been shot earlier this morning.
The suspect is Tim Johnson, a white male, described by Gwatney's secretary as wearing khaki pants, white shirt, silver-gray hair, late 40s.
He reportedly walked into the party headquarters facilities in Little Rock, Arkansas, conversed with the Chairman's secretary, refused her offer of bumper stickers, and then walked past her saying he had to see the Chairman.
After the shooting, Johnson got into his blue Chevrolet pickup truck and led police on a 25-mile chase.
The end result was the shooting of the suspect, who was airlifted to a hospital and eventually died of his wounds.
According to The New York Times, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton issued a joint statement saying, We are stunned and shaken by today's shooting at the Arkansas Democratic Party where our good friend and fellow Democrat Bill Gwatney was critically wounded ...
Bill is not only a strong chairman of Arkansas' Democratic Party, but he is also a cherished friend and confidante.
Gwatney was also a car dealership owner and former state senator.

David Hempleman-Adams left St. John's at approximately 930 p.m. local time on July 2, 2007 from St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador in a small helium filed balloon in an attempt to make the Trans-Atlantic crossing in the smallest balloon ever to make such a crossing.
The final destination of the landing is not known and will be determined as the flight nears its end.
The craft is made of light weight material with just enough space for necessary equipment and cooking implements.
The basket is small and has openings in the side for Hempleman-Adams to extend his legs as he sleeps.
Hempleman-Adams is hoping to make the crossing in three to four days and reach Europe by July 5 or 6th.
Major British charity Comic Relief has invested money in arms, alcohol and tobacco firms, according to a BBC Panorama investigation to be broadcast this evening.
The probe discovered evidence of hundreds of thousands of pounds going towards shares in weapons firms like BAE Systems and alcohol company Diageo.
It is also alleged to have pledged upwards of Â£3 million into tobacco firms.
Ethical fund manager Helen Wildsmith told Panorama If people who've been giving them money, after watching the television, next year think twice and don't give that money, because they're concerned about their investment policy, then that could be argued to be a breach of fiduciary duty.
They're risking their reputation, and a charity's reputation is very precious.
Comic Relief was founded in 1985, and since then has taken in nearly Â£1 billion in donations.
It funds charitable organisations in the United Kingdom as well as overseas.
It uses a range of managed funds, which invests the money in the charity's name - including on the stock market - in order to maximise return.
A spokesperson for the charity told the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph We put the money into large managed funds, as many other leading charities and pension funds do.
On balance, we believe this is the approach that will deliver the greatest benefits to the most vulnerable people.
The controversial investments were made between 2007 and 2009, Panorama explains.
Peter Bennett-Jones, former chair of the company, defended the investments in a post on The Guardians website.
He said The Charity Commission guidance is quite clear that trustees must invest for the best possible financial return, while taking a level of risk appropriate for money in their care.
They should only adopt an ethical investment approach with specific justification and not on the grounds of individual moral views.
Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan has today handed down his last budget before the 2013 Federal election.
He announced two financial years of deficits before the budget returned to surplus in 20162017.
This year, we've faced the second largest revenue write down since the Great Depression, he said.
There is to be a A$60 billion write down over four years.
Because of our deep commitment to jobs and growth, we have taken the responsible course to delay the return to surplus, and due to a savage hit to tax receipts, there will be a deficit of $18 billion in 201314.
Infrastructure spending includes A$12.9 million to connect more local governments to the national broadband network, A$40 million on other local government infrastructure, investment in Brisbane's cross river rail and Melbourne's Metro rail system.
People earning the Newstart Allowance can now earn more from paid employment before there payments from the government are cut.
Mr Swan announced the so called Baby Bonus was to be merged into the Family Tax Benefit Part A.
Family Payment system reshuffle leaves poorest worse off! Australian Greens leader Christine Milne tweeted.
In light of an oil spill that occurred off the coast of southeast Queensland in 2009, a captain of a cargo ship and four companies are set to appear in court.
In March of last year, the cargo ship Pacific Adventurer, with Filipino national Bernardino Gonzales Santos at the helm, encountered bad weather, which resulted in its fuel tank being damaged by loose cargo, leading to the spillage 270,000 litres of oil into the Pacific Ocean.
The oil later washed up on Sunshine Coast beaches as well as Moreton and Bribie islands and was dubbed one of Australia's worse environmental disasters by the media.
Santos and four companies behind Pacific Adventurer face individual counts of discharging oil into the ocean and can be fined a maximum of AU$1.75 million in the case of the companies, while Santos faces a $350,000 fine if found guilty.
Santos is also charged with not taking reasonable action following the incident.
Like Swire Shipping, China Navigation Company LTD and Bluewing Shipping LTD, who are both joint owners of Pacific Adventurer, pleaded not guilty to all charges.
However, prosecutor Peter Davis stated that [t]he prosecution's case is that the cause of the cargo going overboard was due to faulty lashings [...]
The European Union would like to make it easier to dismiss employees.
Then, thanks to the improved flexibility of the market, it should be simpler to find a job.
Surveys show that Europeans mostly seem to agree with the need to adapt and change.
The concept of flexicurity, preached by the European Commission, is aimed to encourage EU governments to unfasten their employment policies.
According to VladimÃ­r Å pidla, the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs & Equal Opportunities, a too protective employment policy may paralyze the labour-market.
Such a policy extends the time needed for jobseeking and the period of unemployment, writes the Commission in its report.
On its paper, the Commission is inspired by the social model of the Scandinavian countries - namely by the social system established in Denmark in the late 1990's.
Don Brash, leader of the opposition National Party in New Zealand, admitted that he was aware that members of the Exclusive Brethren church were going to release contentious brochures attacking his political rivals.
Mr Brash said he had met members of the church a number of times.
He has admitted today that he was aware of the group's intention to publish brochures that were critical of the Labour Party and The Greens.
A spokesman for the Group admitted to having spent NZ$500,000 on the campaign so far.
The pamphlets were published without the link to the Church being obvious.
However, former members of the Church identified the men as belonging to the church which has been described as a sect.
Its members are not allowed to listen to Radio, Television or use computers at all.
There are approximately 2000 members in New Zealand and active branches in the US and Australia.
They are linked to political support for George Bush and other conservative politicians.
Former Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon, 78, has developed double pneumonia and is being treated with massive amounts of antibiotics according to hospital officials.
We are talking about pneumonia that is being treated with massive antibiotics.
There is no change in the functioning of the brain tissue and no significant fall in vital signs, said officials at Tel Hashomer hospital in the Sheba Medical Center located in Tel Aviv, in a statement today.
Yesterday doctors stated that Sharon's urine ouput had decreased significantly and that a scan of his brain showed a deterioration in his brain function, said Anat Dolev, a Sheba Medical Center spokesman.
Yesterday the hospital reported that the condition of Sharon was getting worse.
Sharon has been in a coma since suffering a major stroke on January 4.
Since being admitted to the hospital, he has undergone several rounds of surgery on his brain in an attempt to stop bleeding.
An anti-APEC rally through the streets of Sydney has attracted around 5000 demonstrators, with up to 18 arrests and two police injured.
In the days leading up to the rally, police had warned that the demonstration could attract up to 20,000 people and turn into a full scale riot, however these fears were not realised.
The mostly peaceful demonstration marched from Sydney's Town Hall to Hyde Park where they were greeted with a carnival atmosphere.
The demonstrators protested against the 2003 Iraq invasion, climate change, workers' rights and globalisation with many blowing whistles, yelling chants and beating drums.
While reports in the media vary, up to 18 people were arrested when they turned violent.
Two police officers were injured, one when hit by an iron bar and another when he was hit with a dart.
Those arrested have been charged with offences ranging from assaulting police, hindering police, resisting arrest, offensive conduct and breaching a secure area.
Despite the arrests, NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione praised the conduct of the majority of protesters.
Mr Scipione credited the huge numbers of police and poor weather for the successful outcome of the rally.
It certainly caused numbers to dwindle, in fact it surely caused numbers not to turn up, he said.
But more importantly, I think it was the combination of the show of force, the police were out there in big numbers, and we don't apologise for that.
We always indicated that we would be there, in sufficient numbers to be able to act swiftly against those that broke the law.
Security surrounding the APEC summit is the tightest ever seen in Australia with a 5 km fence restricting access to Northern parts of Sydney's CBD, overflights by airforce jets, police on jet skis, snipers, riot squad members and special laws to crack down on security during the summit.
There have been complaints about the conduct of police which are alleged to of misused special search powers which only apply to the fenced zone surrounding APEC facilities and of heavy-handedness by police.
Several protesters claimed that Sydney had been turned into a police state as a result of the security measures.
Commissioner Scipione said all allegations of police misconduct would be investigated.
A second protest, held in Belmore Park attracted around 1,000 people from Vietnamese and Tibetian backgrounds protested against Chinese President Hu Jinato's human rights record.
Organiser of the protest, Tenpa Dugdak said Australian Prime Minister John Howard should make human rights in China an APEC issue.
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has announced a review into the 'social effects' of gambling, throwing doubt over the government's previous plans to grant a license for a 5,000 mÂ² 'supercasino'.
The review, to take place in September, will look at whether regeneration in the areas for the super-casinos may be a better way of meeting their economic and social needs than the creation of super-casinos.
Gordon Brown made the announcement during Prime Ministers questions, in response to a question from Labour MP Andy Reed.
The plan to allow the building of a single supercasino, and 16 smaller casinos, was set in motion by previous Prime Minister Tony Blair.
An independent Casino Advisory Panel had recommended in February 2007 that the supercasino license should be granted to the city of Manchester, a recommendation which the Government was expected to follow.
The new announcement by Gordon Brown throws doubt over these plans, and BBC News are quoting an unnamed 'Whitehall source' as having commented that the supercasino plan is dead in the water.
A man has died after he was hit by a large wave and swept out to sea in Blackpool, England.
The 44-year-old victim was reportedly stood on the steps near to Cocker Square when he was hit by the wave.
Witnesses looked on as the man was swept out to sea.
Watch manager Su Daintith released a statement confirming the death of the individual.
The man we believe was about to enter the water at the bottom of the sea wall steps when he was swept off without any warning by a large wave which was a result of the overnight weather conditions, they said.
Our thoughts are with his family and friends during this tragic time.
RNLI lifeboats, coastguard officers and the RAF received reports of a man in the sea around lunchtime.
A lifeboat crew managed to retrieve him from the water, and he was transported by ambulance to Blackpool Victoria Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
Progress M-08M, an unmanned Russian cargo spacecraft, departed for the International Space Station (ISS) on Wednesday from the Baikonur Cosmodrome to resupply the orbital outpost.
The rocket carrying the craft, a Soyuz-U, lifted off at 711 pm Moscow time (1511 GMT).
Russian Space Agency officials deemed the launch a success after the Progress successfully achieved orbit and separated from the third stage of the rocket.
Docking of the spacecraft with the ISS is expected to occur on Saturday.
The Progress will deliver more than 2.5 metric tons of supplies and essentials to the orbiting American-Russian crew, as well as gifts and letters from the crew members' families.

Russian president Dmitriy Medvedev met with the Khaled Meshaal, leader of the Hamas group, earlier this week in Syria, prompting criticism from Israel.
Medvedev, during the meeting, had encouraged Hamas to reconciliate with rival Fatah; a spokeswoman quoted him as saying that no one should be left out of the peace process.
He also requested that an Israeli soldier captured by Hamas in 2006, Gilad Shalit, be released, although this was refused by Hamas, who says that Shalit wouldn't be released unless there was an honourable prisoner exchange with Israel.
Shortly before his conversation with Meshaal, Medvedev also held a meeting with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.
A statement by the Israeli foreign ministry read Hamas is a terror organization whose declared goal is the destruction of the state of Israel.
Hamas is responsible for the murder of hundreds of innocent civilians, among them immigrants from the Soviet Union and also Russian citizens.
Israel has always stood by Russia in its struggle against the Chechnyan terrorism.
We expect the same attitude when we are talking about the Hamas terrorism against Israel.
Ha'aretz, an Israeli newspaper, described the meeting as being a surprise for the country.
Andrei Nesterenko, a spokesman for the Russian foreign ministry, responded to Israel's comments, saying Hamas is not an artificial structure.
It is a movement that draws on the trust and sympathy of a large number of Palestinians.
It is known that all other participants of the Middle East quartet are also in some sort of contact with Hamas leadership, although for some unknown reason they are shy to publicly admit it.
Only a few countries in Europe, including Russia, maintain ties with Hamas; the European Union and the United States regard it as a terrorist organisation.
Former Major League Baseball pitcher and coach Pat Dobson died of leukemia Wednesday, November 22.
He died at age 64 at a local San Diego hospital only a day after being diagnosed with the disease.
Dobson is best known for winning 20 games in the 1971 season for the Baltimore Orioles.
Dobson finished his 11 year career with a career win-loss record of 122-129 and with a 3.54 ERA in eleven seasons.
Dobson later became a pitching coach for several teams, last appearing for the Orioles in 1996.
At his death he was a special assistant to San Francisco Giants general manager Brian Sabean, where he worked the past nine years.
United States Senator Hillary Clinton has been holding discussions about and interviewing potential campaign staff for a White House bid in 2008.
Clinton met with Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer Sunday about support if she chooses to run.
She said before the election that after the election she would be considering a presidential run, said senior Clinton advisor Howard Wolfson.
Part of that process is seeking the advice and counsel of her colleagues in New York.
One New York Democrat, who asked to not be named, said he was recently called by a senior Clinton team member.
While it was not said that Clinton had chosen to run for president, it was pretty clear.
New York senior Senator Charles Schumer, Clinton's Democratic colleague, told Associated Press (AP) he would be meeting with Clinton in the next week.
She wants to sit down and talk next week, which we're going to do.
I have no idea what it's about, and until we sit down and talk that's all I'm going to say about it.
I think she'd make a very good president but let's wait and see.
Last week, Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack announced he would seek the Democratic nomination.
Indiana Democrat Senator Evan Bayh announced Sunday he is considering running for the White House.
Clinton tops every national poll of likely Democratic candidates and had tried to keep private many of her overtures to supporters and new staff.
The deliberations have started to become more public in the last week as the field of likely contenders has begun to expand.
Illinois Senator Barack Obama, has attracted tremendous publicity around a possible run without committing himself.
He has jumped to second place behind Clinton in many polls.
Obama's emergence as a potential contender has led some observers to suspect Clinton has stepped up her timetable for making a decision about a run.
Her aides dismiss that notion, saying she is observing the timetable she has long planned.
Other likely candidates include 2004 nominee Senator John Kerry; his vice presidential running mate, former North Carolina Senator John Edwards; New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson; and Senators Joe Biden of Delaware and Christopher Dodd of Connecticut.
Four people have been injured after a series of earthquakes struck West Sumatra in Indonesia.
Sudirman Gani, head of the local administration's politics and national unity division, stated that the first quake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale was recorded at 248 p.m.
It was followed by a 5.2-magnitude quake at 313 p.m., before the last one, measuring 5.6 on the Richter scale, hit 10 minutes later.
The wounded were taken to Yos Sudarso public hospital with minor injuries.
The first earthquake occurred 38 miles (45 kilometres) under the Indian Ocean according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
Indonesia's meteorological and geophysics agency did not issue a tsunami warning.
Ade Edward, West Sumatra's disaster mitigation coordinator, said that We have told all residents to stay alert and not to worry too much since we will guard the city [Padang].
The British Assets Recovery Agency is investigating Â£30 million  â‚¬44 million of assets believed to be owned by senior members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA or IRA), using information provided by the Irish Criminal Assets Bureau and British and Irish law enforcement agencies.
The money is believed to represent a small fraction of the wealth obtained by the organisation.
Most of the assets are believed to have been owned by the IRA chief of staff, Thomas Murphy and businessman Dermot Craven.
Now that negotiations over weapons decommissioning are over, it is believed that other IRA members who have become rich through running protection rackets or other criminal activities may also be stripped of their illegal assests in the forthcoming weeks.
Businesses and organisations paying money towards protection rackets are hoping that the structure of the IRA will now begin to unravel.
Rescuers are continuing their efforts to reach the trapped miners in the Beaconsfield mine in northern Tasmania.
A five tonne borer drilling machine has been secured in place to drill a one metre hole through the remaining 12-16 metres of rock that fell into the main shaft.
Since drilling began at 7pm last night, the machine has made a 2 cm wide pilot hole half way to the miners.
The trapped miners have been given egg sandwiches and yogurt, and have received apple ipod MP3 players filled with the miners favourite songs to pass the time and drown out the sounds of the drilling.
Meanwhile on the surface, the ever-growing media frenzy in Beaconsfield has forced the mine operators to enforce bag checks of rescuers entering the mine to ensure that no recording devices are taken into the mine.
The Saskatchewan Roughriders have won the 95th Grey Cup in Toronto, Canada on Sunday after defeating the Winnipeg Blue Bombers by a 23-19 score.
Saskatchewan last won the Cup in 1989, and their last appearance at the championship game was in 1997 against the Toronto Argonauts.
The Canadian Football League (CFL) championship game was held at Toronto's Rogers Centre before a crowd of 52,230.
This is the first time these two western Canadian teams have met in a Grey Cup final.
Despite Winnipeg's lead during the first and third quarters, Saskatchewan's offence proved too strong for the Blue Bombers in the end.
A half-time performance by rock musician Lenny Kravitz included the song American Woman, originally performed by Winnipeg band The Guess Who.
On Thursday, Saskatchewan quarterback Kerry Joseph was declared this year's CFL Outstanding Player at a player awards ceremony in Toronto.
The Cup is named after Earl Grey who donated the trophy to honour Canada's most successful amateur rugby team.
By the time the Canadian Football League was formed in 1958, the Cup became the top prize for professional football in Canada.
Next year's CFL championship game is scheduled at Montreal's Olympic Stadium.
Resulting from the Israeli bombings on July 13 and 15, 2006 of the Jiyeh power station, located on the coast 30 kilometers south of Beirut, Lebanon, approximately 35,000 tons of heavy fuel oil have spilled into the Mediterranean Sea.
The Lebanese Ministry of Environment expects additional tonnage to flow into the sea as a result of the damage.
For comparison, the Exxon Valdez oil spill released nearly 40,000 tons.
According to Berj Hatjian from the Lebanon Ministry of Environment, What we have here is equivalent to a tanker sinking, and 20,000 to 30,000 tonnes reaching the shoreline.
Furthermore, several storage tanks caught fire due to the blast of the bombardment and continued to burn uncontrollably for 10 days after.
Wind and water currents have spread the oil slick across 70-80 kilometers of Lebanon coastline.
April 7, 2005 The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating allegations of wrongdoing in the building of a new $1.5 billion skyway portion of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, according to a report published in the Oakland Tribune.
The bridge spans the San Francisco Bay between Oakland and Yerba Buena Island.
The paper reported that welders for KFM, the company under contract to build the bridge, told authorities they were pressured â€“ and even paid monthly bonuses of between $200 and $600 â€“ for performing substandard welds on the support piers for the bridge if it meant the project proceeded faster.
But Caltrans, the state agency in charge of building the bridge said their inspectors checked the welds and determined the work, although rushed, met safety standards.
We've got good welds, good procedures and everything is in place to have a quality product.
If a defect got in, we can't find it, Pete Siegenthaler, Caltrans project manager told the Tribune in an interview.
A KFM spokesman told the Tribune that the welds are in compliance with stringent Caltrans specifications.
According to a report by Oakland television station, KTVU, the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Department of Transportation are joining the FBI in the investigation of the matter.
The federal government is getting involved in the investigation because more than $1 million in U.S. taxpayer money was spent during its construction.
If questionable welds are found in the support piers, according to reports, much of the new construction may have to be torn down to be rebuilt.
The current 68-year-old span was damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
At $6.2 billion total, the new bridge qualifies as the largest public works project in California's history.
The New Zealand A1GP team, with racer Jonny Reid, placed seventh in A1GP feature race and picked up four championship points in the second round at Brno track, Czech Republic.
New Zealand managed to secure themselves first place in the qualifying race by being fastest in all four qualifying segments with a time of 330.053, Germany second with 330.524.
This put New Zealand in the pole position to start the sprint race.
When racing for the 20 minute sprint race started Germany and New Zealand 'locked horns' before the very first corner.
It ended with both cars crashing out of the race.
This crash made both New Zealand and Germany start from the end of the track for the feature race.
New Zealand managed to crawl their way back to get seventh place, but dropped to fourteenth place from twelfth, out of 23 competing nations, on the leader board with only five points.
David Sears, Engineering Team Director for both Germany and New Zealand, said Reid and his German counterpart Nico HÃ¼lkenberg were warned about keeping apart...but still ended up making life difficult for themselves.
Sears added To finish first you must first finish and the track is incredibly wide here at Brno, so why New Zealand and Germany should be rubbing wheels on the very first corner is anyone's guess.
To recover and finish strongly was encouraging for Jonny and the car certainly has the raw speed and looks to be one of the quickest going around.
That's the pleasing part amid the disappointment and we now need to refocus and prepare for the next month's round in China.
We were so much quicker than the other teams in qualifying that it would be criminal to be banging wheels when a great result is there for the taking.
The next A1GP race takes place on November 12 in Beijing.
A U.S. F-15 fighter aircraft crashed into the ocean early Tuesday approximately 45 miles off the coast of Ikeijima island, part of the Okinawa chain.
The pilot, whose name was not released, ejected safely and was rescued.
The New Zealand Medical Association (NZMA) has warned the public against taking party pills, even though they are legal in New Zealand.
This warning comes because Benzylpiperazine, or BZP, can trigger hypothermia, seizures, paranoia, insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, palpitations and spasms of the muscle.
Some of those side effects will occur if the person has taken 4.5 tablets.
Those who do take party pills should not mix them with medication, drugs or alcohol.
Also those with mental illnesses are advised to steer clear of the pills.
Ross Boswell, chairman of the medical association, said There were growing concerns about the safety of BZP-based party pills, and the legality of the pills is coming under fire.
If people insist on taking the pills, they should make sure they stick to the manufacturer's recommended dose, of one or two pills, and not combine them with other stimulants.
A study done at the Christchurch Hospital has shown that 61 patients had been to the emergency department a total of 80 times.
Of those 80 times, 15 of them were toxic seizures and two patients presented life threatening conditions.
The pills are often sold as herbal highs but according to Boswell, there is nothing herbal about them as they were first made to treat cattle that had worms.
Boswell said Further research on the effects of BZP is soon to be released by the Health Minister, as the New Zealand government is debating whether or not they should be banned or have their sale restricted.
A spiritual guru known as Swami Amritachaitanya is being held in Kerala, India on charges of fraud, rape and possession of narcotic drugs.
Swami Amritachaitanya, whose real name is Santosh Madhavan, was arrested by Interpol in March on criminal charges in a police raid at his 16-suite ashram in Kochi, India following multiple police complaints against him.
Indians living in Bahrain have recently come forward and filed a case against Madhavan in India on allegations of fraudulent practices related to his supposed charity activities.
Twenty Indians living in Bahrain filed a case against 35-year old Madhavan on Tuesday.
They claim they were victims of a scam after Madhavan convinced them to invest in a charitable organization and tourist resort, but allegedly kept the money for himself.
Twenty of us have e-mailed a complaint to the Inspector General and Commissioner of Ernakulam police as well as Kerala Home Minister, said complainant Jaya Kumar in a statement to the Gulf Daily News.
Ernakulam is a district in the state of Kerala in India.
He was very convincing about his charity activities as well as the resort, said Kumar, a purchasing officer at a company in Bahrain.
Police began an investigation into Madhavan in April after a woman filed a complaint alleging he had promised to start a business with her after a meeting in Dubai, but she said he disappeared after she gave him the money.
Serafin Edwin traveled to the capital of Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram, last week from her residence in Dubai, in order to give testimony against Madhavan.
She was greeted at the international airport by police, and is under police protection due to concerns for her safety.
Her family members told Khaleej Times that she feared physical harm from Madhavan or his henchmen.
Interpol has been investigating Madhavan in allegations related to his business dealings with Serafin Edwin since 2004.
I am happy that the police finally caught up with him and he is in prison.
He is a big fraud and everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie, said Serafin Edwin in a statement to the United Arab Emirates paper The National.
Madhavan was arrested by Interpol police after multiple underage girls went to law enforcement with allegations of rape and sexual abuse.
According to Press Trust of India, police in India received complaints from three underage girls alleging he had raped them.
The Times reported that Madhavan is accused of making pornographic movies with underage girls, sexual assault, rape, fraud and possession of narcotics.
A police raid of Madhavan's four-story mansion in India uncovered drugs, a police uniform, a pelt from an endangered tiger and pornographic DVDs.
Gulf Daily News reported that Madhavan was arrested in Kerala in conjunction with an Interpol red alert, which was issued after consultation with Dubai police in 2004.
Self styled godmen and gurus are under increased observation by police in India following the arrest of Madhavan, and police are specifically investigating their sources of wealth and possible fraud.
But we wonâ€™t allow illegal activities under the guise of spirituality, said Kerala home minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan in a statement to Howrah News Service.
G. Sudhakaran, Kerala's minister for temples, presented a different viewpoint in a statement to The Times.
Theyâ€™re conducting all kinds of criminal and material activities behind their spiritual exteriors.
There are so many swamis who have enlightened the hearts and minds of people, but these people are fakes with no idea about spirituality.
They are only interested in women and money and muscle power, said Sudhakaran.
Many Hindus were upset by Sudhakaran's words, as some devout Hindus consider swamis to be above the law and should not be criticized.
The price for a barrel of oil dropped after news broke that Al Qaeda's leader in Iraq Abu Musab al-Zarqawi had been killed in a US airstrike Thursday.
The death of al-Zarqawi seems to have been interpreted by the market as good news for the future supply of oil from the region.
This is against the backdrop in 2006 when the price of oil had reached a record high of $70 a barrel.
Today on the New York Mercantile Exchange light crude futures for July dropped from over $70 a barrel to a low of $69.54 before rising to $69.63 for a $1.19 loss.
There's less of a terror threat in Iraq now, said Naohiro Niimura, vice president of energy derivatives at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd, in Tokyo, who gave his reason for the fall.
Iraq lies over one-third of known oil reserves but since the Iraq war in 2003 has been unable to pump more than 2 million barrels a day - 1 million less than prior to the coalition invasion.
In May exports were said to be 1.5 million bpd.
The line on a graph that plotted oil price had done a steady incline over recent years, though many factors are involved in the price of a barrel of oil so it is almost impossible to say how much the troubles in Iraq contributed to this rise.
Iraq's exports make up the largest proportion of its Gross Domestic Product and a significant proportion of world supply.
Investors were said to have been worried about developing in the country citing lack of security and legal protection.
Al-Zarqawi, known for videotaped beheadings, suicide bombing campaigns against coalition forces and civilians and reportedly some attacks on oil infrastructure inside Iraq, had claimed responsibility for bombing three hotels in Amman, Jordan.
It was hoped the death of Osama bin Laden's operative in Iraq would remove a man who had opposed the US-backed Shiite-led state and western influence in the wider-region.
The Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's recent appointment of new security and home affairs ministers also may have affected the oil market.
Director general of marketing and economics at the Iraqi oil ministry said both pieces of news together were a positive indicator for security, said Shamkhi Faraj.
Other voices sounded a note of caution against the optimism The situation in Iraq has now become so chaotic, that it transcends the death of one man, influential as al-Zarqawi was, said Edward Meir.
The analyst at Man Financial believes the threat to the Iraqi oil industry is political as well as physical.
Yes, al Qaeda attacked oil installations but they were not the only actors and they were not the main actors, he said.
There is also a new factor -- political parties that are using threats against oil to gain leverage.
In an announcement about oil, Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih of the Iraqi government said it hoped to produce 4.3 million bpd in four years.
Saturday evening, at approximately 700 p.m. PST on Mt. Washington in Los Angeles, California, a brush fire broke out on the southwestern side of the hill.
Firefighters were on the scene by 830 p.m. with fire trucks, paramedic units, surveillance helicopters, and water-equipped helicopters.
Two fire trucks blasted water at the blaze from higher up on the mountain, while every minute or so, a water-equipped helicopter would swoop down over the flames and release its payload.
At the top of the hill, there were five fire trucks and one paramedic unit; the three main entrances to the mountain were barricaded off by fire trucks.
By approximately 915 p.m., the flame was entirely extinguished, thanks mainly to the water-equipped helicopters.
Firefighters were offering bystanders bottles of water and Gatorade to help combat the effects of standing near an open flame.
On Thursday, London's Mayor Boris Johnson announced the shortlist of bidders to supply up to ten further trams to Transport for London (TfL) for use on the city's Tramlink network in Croydon.
TfL, who purchased the Tramlink network from Tramtrack Croydon Ltd. in 2008, announced the plans late January, after submitting the tender to the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) on January 29.
According to the notice, the additional trams will operate approximately 75,000km per year, will be needed for at least 10, but not more than 20 years and can be either new build or existing vehicles that can be modified â€” at a reasonable cost â€” to run on the Tramlink infrastructure.
The tram fleet is currently made up of 24 Bombardier CR4000 trams, which were constructed for the opening of the 28km network between 1998 and 2000.
22 of these trams are currently needed to operate the three tram routes each day, and the new service is expected to require at least an additional five trams daily, bringing about the need for a boost to the fleet levels.
The shortlist to supply the trams consists of City of EdinburghCAF, Stadler (Stadler Pankow GmBH) and Pesa (Pojazdy Szynowe PESA Bydgoszcz S.A.Holding, and the the three consortia will now be invited to submit proposals to supply the additional trams.
It is not currently known whether the bids made by Stadler and Pesa will be for new-build or second-hand vehicles, however the bid from EdinburghCAF is to use a number of the currently-dormant trams that were constructed for that city's own tram network.
The system has had several set backs since construction began, with the network now set to open in stages with a number of tram lines (but not the trams to operate them) being cancelled, leading to a large surplus of vehicles that could be hired out in the short term.
The trams are amongst some of the longest and heaviest in Europe, though, and will require a large amount of modification to enable them to be able to operate on Croydon's network if the bid is successful.
Shortly after the announcement, whilst inspecting one of the network's current trams at East Croydon tram stop, Boris Johnson said I have no greater responsibility as Mayor than to ensure people can move around this city with ease, comfort and reliability.
Trams in Croydon have proved a major success and this is reflected in journey numbers which have soared by 45 per cent since the network opened in 2000.
I look forward to the extra vehicles developing this vital, much-appreciated, and indeed attractive, form of transport further.
Funding for the new trams is expected to largely come from TfL, however the London Borough of Croydon has also confirmed a Â£3m contribution to the project.
This will also include the refurbishment of tram stop surrounds.
Croydon Council Leader Mike Fisher said This is looking like a great deal for Croydon and shows the benefits of an ambitious local authority and committed Mayor working together, pooling resources and expertise.
There is real support to get additional trams for Croydon to keep pace with growing demand for Tramlink services and also to secure major improvements for pedestrians and transport users around and between East and West Croydon stations.
TfL anticipates that, providing a successful bid is made, the new trams would be delivered to the network's depot at Therapia Lane in late 2011, with an entry into service from early 2012.
Three are dead after a tornado hit Cincinnati, a small town in Arkansas, about three miles from Oklahomaâ€™s border.
Around 600 local time, on Friday, the system, fed by warm winter air, caused several injuries, damaging the power grid.
Josh Howerton, the countyâ€™s sheriffâ€™s dispatcher, stated that the storm touched down near the townâ€™s center.
A tornado warning for Cincinnati and nearby towns was issued by the Tulsa weather center nine minutes before the storm struck.
Any time you have a significant change in air mass there is going to be unsettled weather marking the two different air masses, said Joe Sellers, a meteorologist from the National Weather Service in Oklahoma.
Alain Corneau, a French film director, has died at the age of 67.
Born on August 7, 1943, Corneau's first interest was music.
Before the success of his first film, Corneau attempted to make a documentary about New York and an adaptation of a novel.
After working as assistant director on L'Aveu with Costa Gavras he directed his first film in 1973, France, Inc.
Corneau's other films include La Menace, Fort Saganne, and the highly successful Tous les matins du monde.
Tous les matins du monde received 11 CÃ©sar Award nominations and won seven of them.
The awards included Best Film, Best Director, and Best Music.
Corneau said in a 1992 interview in the New York Times that Many people got emotional about this film, and that made it possible for it to escape cult status.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy commented on the death of Corneau.
He said Corneau was a courageous man and a great director.
Corneau was set to appear at the Toronto Film Festival in September.
In Iran, the state-controlled TV station has announced that the country for the first time test-fired a space rocket, with scientific equipment aboard.
The first space rocket has been successfully launched into space, the station's website reported.
The rocket was later reported not be designed to reach an orbit.
Iran claims it reached an altitude of 94 miles and then parachuted home.
No images have been released, and no other reports have confirmed the launch.
The announcement comes at a time of international tension over Iran's nuclear program.
In a speech today, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad compared his country's nuclear program with a train with no brakes and no reverse gear.
Manouchehr Mohammadi, a deputy foreign minister, said the country had prepared itself for a standoff over its nuclear activities.
Diplomats said that if Iran would possess advanced missile capabilities it would be of concern to the nations who believe Iran is developing nuclear weapons, something Iran denies.
The head of the Iranian space center, Mohsen Bahrami, was quoted saying that the scientific material on board came from the science and from the defence ministry.
He also said that the test was in line with international regulations on the matter.
Although the news would mean a significant breakthrough for Iran's missile technology, the story was only mentioned during one TV broadcast, and not at all by other official Iranian media.
Iran has said in the past it wants more satellites to increase its cellular phone and internet capabilities.
It also said it hopes to become a center for science and technology in the region.
Since 2005, Iran already has one satellite in space, Sinah-1, which was launched in Russia with a Russian rocket.
The rocket was described as serving telecommunication and research purposes.
Soon after the 2005 launch, Iran announced they would develop their own launcher.
Yesterday, the Iranian Defence Minister spoke of Iran's plans for their own satellite launcher, and disclosed his country's desire to join the club of countries with a space program.
With an election coming up this Saturday in the Australian state of Queensland, Wikinews reporter Patrick Gillett previews the contesting parties.
The current distribution of seats has the Australian Labor Party with 58 of the 86 total, the Liberal National Party with 25, the Queensland Greens & One Nation with one each and independents holding four.
The Australian Labor Party (ALP) is currently in government and have been since 1998.
Current premier and leader of the ALP Anna Bligh will be, if Labor wins, the first female to elected premier in Australian history.
Ms Bligh became the third female premier in Australian history when Peter Beattie resigned in 2007.
The premier has received criticism from other parties for backflipping on its commitment to run a full term.
After 11 years in office, Ms Bligh only cares about one job her own, said Lawrence Springborg head of the Liberal National Party (LNP) and the Leader of the Opposition.
It is seen as a prototype for a national merger between the Liberal and National parties.
The Opposition need to pick up at least twenty seats from the government to overcome the significant Labor majority and a number of independents.
The Greens unveiled its policy to open two solar power stations on the weekend of January 31February 1.
We can tackle climate change and create long-term jobs, but Labor can't see that because they are blinded by the interests of their big donors - the urban development and coal industries, said Mt Coo-tha candidate Larrisa Waters.
The Greens main policies have been stated Green collar jobs, managing where the money is going, education and transport.
The Greens want to give the community and the environment a voice back in State Parliament, says Ms Waters.
The Socialist Alliance will run two candidates as independents because of what they call restrictive rules for registration.
The Daylight Saving for South East Queensland (DS4EQ) party was set up in late 2008.
DS4SEQ leader Jason Furze gave an interview to Wikinews in January.
DS4SEQ would like to gain a sizeable percentage of the primary vote and win a number of seats, Mr furze said.
Courier Mail writer Dennis Atkins wrote in today's Courier Mail that DS4SEQ will poll better than anyone expected - polling close to double figures in some seats around Brisbane and on the coasts.
News Limited newspapers The West Australian and the Courier Mail reported that swing voters would decide the election.
Caloundra lead Glasshouse by 153 runs at stumps on day two of the 2010 Sunshine Coast, Australia division one cricket grand final.
I think the nerves of a grand final gets to you too.
You try and put it in the back of your mind but itâ€™s still there,â€ Glasshouse captain Brett Milini said.
Caloundra were all out in their first inning for 193.
I thought 250 was a par score and I thought we were in with a big chance,â€ Milini said.
If we were good enough, we should have got that pretty easy but we didnâ€™t bat well today.
Caloundra rounded out day two at six out for fifty seven, leaving Glasshouse an outside chance of snatching the championship.
â€œWeâ€™ve given ourselves another chance but if we bat like we did in the first innings, weâ€™re already gone,â€ he said.
â€œIt should be a real good game, itâ€™s interesting cricket.â€
 Results for the second division, third B division, southern fourth division and fifth division traditional grand finals have not been accessible to Wikinews as of this report
A minimum of 85 Hindu pilgrims have been killed in India and 64 injured after their lorry and trailer plunged 24m (80ft) into a river gorge late last night.
Approximately 150 people were on board when the driver lost control on a sharp bend near the village of Nagbavji, Rajasthan, smashing through a concrete crash barrier and continuing down into the valley, coming to rest inverted.
An overnight rescue operation was initiated, removing both survivors and bodies of the dead from the wreck, with the aid of cranes and spotlights.
Ambulances and medical teams rushed to the scene from surrounding areas.
Of the 64 who were hospitalised, three are reported to be in critical condition.
The Press Trust of India reported that as many as 130 were injured, and Al Jazeera reported that there may have been 200 people on board.
It is believed the death toll could rise still further, as many people remain trapped beneath the trailer.
The truck was a 12-wheeled model designed for hauling shipping containers, and was carrying pilgrims from three nearby villages Shiwal, Madri and Bhawa.
The driver had offered to take them to their destination for free, a practise common in India, despite the fact that such trucks are not safe for passenger transport, being designed primarily as freight transporters.
The vehicle had been destined for the temple of Ramdev, a site considered by both Hindus and Muslims as being of high spiritual significance.
The temple is the subject of an annual ten-day pilgrimage every September, which begins on September 13, although most of the 250,000 pilgrims who flock to the site arrive several days in advance of the festival.
The Chief Minister of Rajasthan Vasundhara Raje visited the three villages in which the victims resided.
The local government has initiated a full inquiry into the disaster.
Eyewitness reports say that Islamist insurgents in Somalia have captured the town of Jowhar, a strategically important city 90 kilometres north of the country's capital of Mogadishu.
According to the witness reports the Al-Shabaab rebels took the town after two hours of fighting on Sunday.
After overtaking the city, the militants released prisoners from the city jail.
A resident told Reuters that seven people died in the fighting.
The United Nations Security Council has expressed concern at the loss of life and the worsening humanitarian situation arising out of the renewed fighting.
Meanwhile, in Mogadishu, fighting between government forces and Al-Shabaab has left at least 68 people dead in the past two days.
The Somali government has started to lose ground against Al-Shabaab in the past few weeks.
Currently, it does not control much area outside of the capital which is reinforced by African Union troops.
The ringleaders of the so-called Bali Nine were today sentenced to death by a Denpasar court.
Andrew Chan received the news via translators at about 345 p.m. AEDT, and Myuran Sukumaran was sentenced at about 450 p.m. AEDT.
The two were charged with attempting to smuggle 8.3 kg of heroin from Bali to Australia.
The Australian Federal Police have been criticised for allowing the Bali Nine to travel to Indonesia, where it was known they could face the death penalty.
Yesterday two other drug mules, Renae Lawrence and Scott Rush, were sentenced to life imprisonment.
Chan was alleged to be the mastermind of the operation, and Myuran was alleged to be an enforcer.
Chan, who claimed to have rediscovered his Christian faith, prayed for divine intervention prior to the sentence being handed down.
Chan fell over after jostling with a media scrum, and Sukumaran threw a bottle of water at the media.
Donald Rothwell, a Professor of International Law at the University of Sydney, has said that, unlike countries such as Singapore, it may not be long before the two are executed.
The Indonesian judicial system is one in which death sentences are often carried out very quickly, he said.
So unlike the situation of Van Nguyen in Singapore, where an appeal process and a clemency process played out over quite some time, this may not be the situation in Bali.
Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer told parliament today that he had made a direct request to the Indonesian government that the death penalty not be imposed.
On the 18th of December last year, I wrote to the Indonesian Attorney-General reminding him that the Australian Government was opposed to the death sentence and we didn't want to see, in the context of the Bali nine, any of the Australians sentenced to death, he said.
In Bali the death sentence is carried out by firing squad.
An Israeli rocket has struck the Press TV building in the Gaza Strip.
According to the news agency, other television news stations called Al-Alam and Al Arabiya are also based inside the building.
There was no warning prior to the attack and only journalists were inside the building when the rocket hit.
Press TV states that some of their broadcasting equipment on the building's roof was damaged in the blast.
According to live video being broadcast by Press TV, journalists on the roof are marked with 'TV' or 'press' on their coats and helmets.
Press TV uses the roof of their building to broadcast most of their live video feeds of Gaza.
The agency claims that they were given assurance by the Israeli military that the building would not be targeted.
The agency also states that coordinates of the building were given to the Israeli military everyday so they would not attack the building or mistake news crews for Hamas militants.
Despite the claim by witnesses and Press TV employees, a spokesperson for the IDF states that the building was not a target and was likely a result of collateral damage.
There are no reports of other buildings having been hit in the area around the Press TV building.
Press TV states that regardless of the attack, they are still prepared to show the horrific attacks by the IDF (Israeli Defense Force) with graphic images of children being killed.
Press TV, an Iranian based news agency, is one of few international news agencies broadcasting live video feeds of Gaza and currently has more journalists in Gaza than any other world news agency.
Commemoration of the Srebrenica massacre will be held on July 11, when newly identified bodies will be buried.
In 1995, Serbian forces, according to International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), massacred around 7500 Bosnian Muslims.
It is expected that by July 11 another 550 bodies will be identified and ready for burial.
Robert Mugabe, the Zimbabwean president who has recently been widely criticized by world leaders, has claimed the current results show that he will have a 'sweeping victory' in the unopposed presidential run-off elections.
Mugabe announced his victory on one of the state run television networks.
The returns show that we are winning convincingly, that we have won in all the 26 constituencies in Harare, an MDC stronghold where we won in only one constituency in March, he said.
Robert Mugabe was recently under a large amount of pressure to postpone the election after the main opposition candidate, Morgan Tsvangirai, pulled out due to fears of violence.
For example, Ban Ki-moon, secretary general of the United Nations yesterday called for the election to be postponed.
He said that he strongly supports the statement of the Chairman of SADC (Southern African Development Community) that conditions do not exist for a run-off election to be held at this time and that they should be postponed.
Elections were held in Bulgaria for the 240 members of the Assembly today.
According to exit polls, the Leftist Coalition for Bulgaria has a lead with around 31%, but without majority, neccesating creation of coalitions.
The National Movement for Simeon II which is currently ruling is in the second place, with around 21%.
The third is Ethnic Turks of Bulgaria, with around 11%.
It is expected that the National Movement for Simeon II will attempt to form a coalition with one of the lower placed parties in order to outnumber the Leftists.
At least 6,000 candidates (from 22 parties) ran for election to the 240 member parilament.
4% of the votes are needed to gain a seat.
The opposition Leftist Coalition, headed by Bulgarian Socialist Party lead the election, but did not gain an outright majority.
Sergei Stanishev, leader of the socialist party, stated he would attempt to form a governing coalition.
We are ready to form a government ... and we will negotiate with any democratic party, Stanisheve said in a press conference.
In the last six free elections held since 1989, no government has been re-elected -- each has had to implement stringent economic and social reforms, since the fall of communism, and has lost popular support as a result.
The delegation representing Brazil at the funeral of Yasser Arafat returned today, November 13, 2004.
The chief-minister of Civil House JosÃ© Dirceu was a member of the delegation.
Unfortunately they arrived too late for the funeral and the delegation watched only part of the funeral activities.
PCdoB (Brazilian communist political party) Deputy Jamil Murad, member of the delegation, said there was a deep mourning feeling.
Jamil Murad had visited Yasser Arafat in April 2004, along with nine other Brazilian deputies.
According to Jamil Murad Yasser Arafat was a Palestinian leader who became a world projection leader.
Australia's Allan Davis won the 2009 Tour Down Under professional road cycling race.
Sprint specialist Davis completed Sunday's final stage in the main pack to maintain the lead he had built up in time bonuses from sprint wins earlier in the race.
122 cyclists completed the six day race around a circuit starting and ending at Adelaide, South Australia.
American cyclist Lance Armstrong also participated in the race, his first professional bike race since the 2005 Tour de France.
It is not clear if the seven-time Tour de France winner intended to compete for the general classification, but he did make an unsuccessful breakaway on Sunday in pursuit of a stage victory.
Despite several attacks over the week, Armstrong placed 29th in the general classification.
A spokesperson for Scotland Yard has confirmed that no arrests have been made after Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone was injured in a mugging on Wednesday.
The 80-year-old billionaire was treated in hospital for head injuries he sustained in the attack, in which the four muggers stole Â£200,000 of jewellery from him and his 31-year-old girlfriend.
The attack occurred as Ecclestone visited his company's office with girlfriend Fabiana Flosiâ€”who was reportedly shaken but uninjuredâ€”in central London.
There can be little doubt that this was a targeted robbery because of who Mr. Ecclestone is, a police source said.
The muggers were callous and showed little regard for the victims.
Four years ago, Ecclestone was mugged as he parked his car outside his Â£10 million home in Chelsea Square; two wheels were taken from the car.
Freelance journalist Gabriel Pollard interviewed John Ballinger who has what is believed to be the first unlocked iPhone working in New Zealand on the Vodafone New Zealand GSM network.
Ballinger, director of Bluespark Ltd., managed to unlock the iPhone without having to solder anything.
This is unlike George Hotz, the first person to unlock the iPhone, who had to by using a different method involving soldering.
Ballinger followed the steps on how to unlock it on a website and had watched a few videos the day before.
He described the website, despite containing a few spelling mistakes, as really good.
He says that the spelling mistakes are noticeable and can result in file-not-found errors.
It took Ballinger around four to five hours to complete all necessary steps.
However, half of this time was trying to get the case of the iPhone open.
He also didn't want to scratch the case, unlike others, so he used plastic tools used to replace iPod batteries that worked okay.
He also recommends having two people on this job as this will help when it comes to shorting a circuit.
After that, all you have to do is run some software, according to Ballinger.
The software part is pretty simple, follow the instructions and it could be made even easier if all the files were in one download.
However, he cannot use either the built-in YouTube application or the email applications as it will not connect to the Post Office Protocol.
I can use all of them via the web browser but none by the inbuilt iPhone applications... but I am sure there will be an app you can install that will fix this or a new hack or it's just me.
He can also only get the Internet if there is a Wi-Fi connection, as Vodafone NZ has 3G but no EDGE; additionally, Ballinger could not get the slower GPRS working.
If there was a 3G phone then this phone would be amazing! 
He says he really really does love the iPhone due to its small size, its quietness, and the fact that it does not get hot.
At a Republican rally in Colorado, U.S. Alaskan governor and Vice-Presidential hopeful, Sarah Palin accused Democratic candidate Barack Obama of palling around with terrorists who would target their own country.
The charge was repeated at a later rally for around 13,000 Orange County, California supporters.
The accusation centers around a report in The New York Times associating Obama with William C. Ayers, a Chicago professor who was a member of the radical Weathermen group during the 1960s.
Ayers was one of the founders of the Weathermen, and involved in their anti-Vietnam War bombing campaign throughout the early 1970s.
Loading her attack with hot-button issues, Palin told supporters one of Barack's earliest supporters is a man who, according to the New York Times, and they are hardly ever wrong, was a domestic terrorist and part of a group that quote launched a campaign of bombings that would target the Pentagon and US Capitol.
These are the same guys who think patriotism is paying higher taxes.
Despite Palin's attack, the original article in the October 3 New York Times concluded that Obama and Ayers were never close, and that the connection was through Obama's initial run for office and a schools reform project, saying that their paths have crossed sporadically.
The report quotes Obama as describing Ayers as, somebody who worked on education issues in Chicago that I know and somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago, when I was 8.
According to a campaign spokesman, the two men first met through the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, an educational project started in 1995.
Democratic campaign aides claim the alleged relationship has been played up by the presidential hopeful's opponents as a smear campaign.
Comparisons to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (SBVT) have been drawn.
SBVT was a political group drawn together during the 2004 presidential election with the aim of opposing John Kerry's candidacy.
Toy manufacturer Mattel announced today that they are recalling more products over fears of dangerous levels of lead in the toy's paint.
This soft, but heavy and poisonous metal can be fatal when there is more than 10 Î¼gdL in the blood.
The 800,000 toys have been recalled over safety fears and are thought to be mostly Barbie products.
This recall has increased the concern over the safety of the Chinese production process.
The lead paint was traced to an un-authorised producer and that firm was closed down, however the most recent source has not yet been located.
Chinese production accounts for almost 65% of Mattel's overall production.
Mattel is considered as one of the most stringent producers in the market however their reputation is in danger.
Toys that are currently being produced are being packaged ready for the Christmas rush, however there are fears that if these are recalled then there will be a Christmas shortage.
Various sources have indicated that as of today no significant international aid has arrived in the island of Nias -- a small volcanic island off the coast (North Sumatra province, Indonesia) -- a full ten days after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake occurred.
These observations were noted by former Indonesian central parliament member Firman Jaya Daeli, activists from Howu-howu (a Dutch NGO), and Surf Aid International.
Most international aid in Indonesia has been focused on the province of Naggroe Aceh Darussalam (Aceh), as it is where the biggest number of dead has been reported.
There has also been other reports from local media that the island of Simeulue is suffering similar fate.
Although the number of dead in these two islands is relatively small compared to other areas, the number of people left homeless is far from insignificant.
In Simeulue of the 15 000 households 7 500 have permanently lost their homes.
The number of destroyed houses in Nias is estimated at 4 500.
Infrastructure damage, leading to slow distribution of food aid, has lead to the very real possibility of widespread starvation.
The island is popular with surfers who have mounted a considerable grassroots campaign to provide aid to the island (see links below).
Communication to and from the isolated island proves to be difficult.
Scotland has refused bail to the Libyan man convicted of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 despite his terminal cancer, as he can receive treatment in prison.
Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al-Megrahi was jailed in 2001 for the 1988 bombing of the transatlantic airliner, killing 270 people, but is seeking to have his conviction overturned.
Minutes after Edinburgh's Appeals Court rejected bail on compassionate grounds Jim Swire, spokesman for the victim's families who lost his daughter in the disaster, complained about the ruling.
It has never been a goal of our group to seek revenge, said a lawyer outside the court reading from his statement.
The refusal of a return to his family for a dying man whose verdict is not even yet secure looks uncomfortably like either an aspect of revenge -- or perhaps timidity.
Al-Megrahi, a former intelligence officer, is 54 and serving a minimum of 27 years for the bombing.
He has advanced prostate cancer which is spreading through his body.
His request for bail was rejected by Lord Hamilton, Scotland's head judge, who said that as doctors say he could live a few more years he should not be released unless and until after his appeal succeeds or his condition worsens.
Some other doctors give his time as just months, as the cancer has reached his bones.
Hamilton however said that palliative hormone treatment could prolong his life.
Hamilton also said Al-Megrahi was not suffering material pain or disability.
The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission ruled last year that the conviction may be a miscarriage of justice.
It said there was significant doubts to be raised over several key pieces of evidence in the original trial.
Figures released by the U.S. 2010 census on Wednesday show that the city of Detroit has lost approximately 238,270 people, one-fourth of its total, since 2000.
Detroit, once one of the top five U.S. cities in population, has its lowest number of residents since 1910.
Population numbers affect the the amount of federal and state funding a city receives.
In the last few decades, dozens of Michigan state laws have been passed allowing Detroit, because its population was at least 750,000, special measures to raise revenue and allocating it a larger share of Michigan's state revenue than its population warranted.
Now that Detroit's population has fallen to 713,777, it is no longer eligible for these financial advantages.
The mayor of Detroit, Dave Bing plans to appeal the census results.
Every person thatâ€™s counted in the census brings approximately $10,000 to Detroit over the next decade for schools, roads, hospitals, and social service programs, Bing explained.
Additionally, we could lose millions in statutory revenue sharing from the state.
We are in a fiscal crisis and we have to fight for every dollar.
The decline of the auto industry hastened the population loss already diminished by the 1967 riots that precipitated white flight to the suburbs.
Approximately 23 percent of the cityâ€™s living quarters are now empty.
To reduce the city's size there is a program in progress to demolish 10,000 abandoned or vacant buildings and turn the land into farms or countryside by 2014.
U.S. federal laws forbid drawing congressional district boundaries that dilute minority voting strength.
The 2000 redistricting rules for the 2012 elections mandated that Detroit's two congressional districts must be 60 percent black voters, since four out of five of Detroit's residents are black.
To comply, the two remaining congressional districts will have to expand into Detroit's mostly white suburbs to attain enough minority voters to meet the 60 percent target, reducing the clout of black Detroit.
Andrew Beveridge, Queens College sociology professor, attributed Detroit's population decline to the loss of its industrial base.
He said Except for New Orleans after Katrina, it's basically the largest drop for a U.S. city in history.
They have to find an economic base or the decline will continue.
13 American coal miners were trapped 2 miles (3 kilometers) inside the Sago coal mine in the US state of West Virginia.
They were trapped since 640 am Eastern, Monday, January 2 following a methane gas explosion which caused the shaft to collapse.
Rescue operations have commenced and at last report they were 1,400 feet from the location of the miners.
Governor Joe Manchin, who lost an uncle in a 1968 mining disaster is there along with families who held a vigil in the Sago Baptist Church.
A population study, released by Statistics New Zealand titled A History of Survival in New Zealand, highlights that the life expectancy of New Zealand males born in the mid 1890's would have been five years higher without the impact of the two world wars, as 10% of males died in war.
Also males born in the late 1910's would have had a three year higher life expectancy, without the impact of the two world wars as well.
The new study is an international study of survival and mortality.
The study also reveals that a male born in the late 1870's would have had an average life span of 51-years-old and in the 1930's the average life span was 69-years-old.
And in females the life expectancy is 75-years-old, previously 55-years-old.
Kim Dunstan, Statistics NZ demographer, said The dramatic lifespan changes were attributed to many factors, including improved hygiene, sanitation, medicines and infectious disease control.
People born in the late 1870's had a 23% chance of not making it to see their 15th birthday, people born in the 1900's had a 15% chance, people born in the 1930's had a seven percent chance, people born in the 1960's had a three percent chance and those born around the 1990's had a one percent chance.
Mr Dunstan said The study provided the most complete picture of how long New Zealanders lived and showed for the first time the impact of war deaths on the population.
Death comes to us all and it does affect us at a lot of levels.
A lot of people have had family members who died in the war and can relate to their own experiences.
A History of Survival in New Zealand also shows that New Zealand is one of the few countries in the world that has an almost complete and detailed history of births, deaths and migration information dating back to the late 1800's.
This study is a historic book full of births, deaths and external migration for the population of New Zealand.
It will also be used in the future relating to health, population and mortality areas.
It is also unique because it follows the population from birth right through to death.
We see the study very much as the basis for further work ... across other organisations in New Zealand and, indeed, internationally, Mr. Dunstan said.
The Philippine military said today that gunmen have seized at least 75 people, most of them schoolchildren, after a raid on a remote elementary school in the southern Philippines.
Military officials said that about fifteen gunmen from the Manobo tribe abducted some of the residents of a village on the Mindanao island on Thursday.
The group, reportedly armed with M-14 and M-16 rifles, captured four teachers and the school principal of the New Maasim Elementary School, and an unknown number of students.
The seizure occurred shortly after the flag ceremony, when they were due to start classes.
Two foresters for the Department of Environment and Natural Resources were also taken hostage.
Negotiations are being made to release the captives, according to a local police chief.
We are trying to find out how the others can be released, said Lino Calingasan to the Reuters news agency.
Local police have filed charges against the suspected kidnappers, however, they reported that the gunmen didn't seem to want to hurt or kill the hostages.
Officials said that the gunmen appear to be using them as human shields to escape.
The southern Philippines suffers from frequent banditry, loosely supervised government-armed militias, and Muslim and communist insurgents.
Last month, 57 people in an election convoy were massacred in the southern part of the Maguindanao province, which has since been placed under martial law.
On Tuesday, the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations held a hearing titled Credit Card Practices Unfair Interest Rate Increases.
The hearing examined the circumstances under which credit card issuers may increase the interest rates of cardholders who are in compliance with the terms of their credit cards.
Subcommittee Chairman Carl Levin said in his opening statement Today's focus is on credit card issuers who hike the interest rates of cardholders who play by the rules â€” meaning those folks who pay on time, pay at least the minimum amount due, and wake up one day to find their interest rate has gone through the roof â€” again, not because they paid late or exceeded the credit limit, but because their credit card issuer decided they should be 'repriced'.
Present to testify on behalf of credit card issuers were Roger C. Hochschild of Discover Financial Services, Bruce L. Hammonds of Bank of America Corporation, and Ryan Schneider of Capital One Financial Corporation.
Much of the 90 minute hearing focused on specific cases where interest rates were raised, allegedly because credit scores of the debtor dropped, and not because they were delinquent or otherwise behind on payments.
According to Levin, this practice made it so that almost all payments went towards finance charges with almost none toward repaying the principal.
This, he felt, is an unfair practice, as the credit card companies were negligent in informing their customers of the rate hikes and the reason for such hikes.
The collective credit card debt of Americans totals an estimated US$900 billion.
Issuers have come under pressure to disclose their policies in regards to setting fees and interest rates.
The US Truth in Lending Act requires that terms of a loan be set forth up front.
Fluctuating interest rates on credit cards would, on the surface, appear to violate this act.
Roger C. Hochschild disagreed, arguing that every card transaction is a new extension of credit ...
This makes it difficult â€” and risky â€” to underwrite, and price, the loan based solely on the borrower's credit-worthiness at the time of application [for the card].
Ryan Schneider, agreed The ability to modify the terms of a credit card agreement to accommodate changes over time to the economy or the credit-worthiness of consumers must be preserved.
Attempts to interfere with the market here ... will inevitably result in less credit being offered, warned Bruce Hammonds.
All three credit card executives also mentioned an ongoing Federal Reserve System review of credit card rules that already proposes a 45-day notification ahead of any rate changes.
Included in the criticism was the practice of mailing checks to card-holders, failing to notify applicants that obtaining additional cards could lower their credit score and raise their rates, and ambushing card-holders with raised rates.
Ranking minority member of the subcommittee, Norm Coleman said, families find themselves ensnared in a seemingly inescapable web of credit card debt.
They particularly report being saddled with interest rates that skyrocketed on them seemingly out of the blue.
A fierce storm on Sunday resulted in massive 18-foot waves, which split a Russian oil tanker in two and sank two Russian freighters nearby.
The tanker spilled at least 560,000 gallons of fuel into a strait which leads to the Black Sea, and officials say it may take years to clean up.
The tankers sank in the Strait of Kerch, which links the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov in the northeast.
The two ships were carrying a total of around 7,150 tons of sulfur, according to Sergei Petrov, Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations regional spokesperson.
The tanker was carrying nearly 1.3 million gallons of fuel oil, and was stranded several miles from shore.
Emergency workers were prevented from collecting the spilled oil immediately due to stormy weather; the head of the state environmental safety watchdog Rosprorodnadzor, Oleg Mitvol, said there is serious concern that the spill will continue.
Workers eventually managed to begin work on cleaning up the spill, an effort which may be long-term.
Tar-like sands laden with oil and seaweed were piled on the shore, while oil-covered birds in slick-covered water tried to flap their wings.
Regional coast guard officer Anatoly Yanhuck said once weather improves they will begin pumping oil from the tanker, then tow the ship to port.
Two fuel-loaded barges and Turkish freighter Ziya Kos also ran aground in the area, but there was no further environmental damage, said Petrov.
Ten ships altogether were sunk or run aground in the area of the Black Sea near the Straight of Kerch and the Straight itself; a Russian freighter carrying metal was also reported as having sunk near the port of Sevastopol on Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.
One of the sulfur-carrying freighters reported three crew members as drowned, and five more as missing, while two members of the sunk freighter carrying metal were reported as drowned and another remains missing.
The oil tanker's 13 crew members were all rescued safely, and all members of the second freighter were also reported as safe.
Captains had been warned Saturday morning of the stormy conditions, regional prosecutor Maxim Stepanenko told Russia's Vesti 24.
The oil tanker was not built to withstand fierce storms, having been designed to transport oil on rivers during Soviet times, he said.
Chemist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Ocean Service office of response and restoration, Jim Farr said the sulfur spill from the two freighters wouldn't create a hazardous situation, a statement backed up by Alexei Zhukovin, expert with the Emergency Situations Ministry's branch in Southern Russia.
Although on land sulfur is used as a fungicide, in a marine setting it wouldn't act as one, said Farr; instead a sulfur spill can be compared to dumping sand on a reef and smothering it, or placing a blanket on a bed of grass.
Long-term effects are more difficult to speculate on, however, without better knowledge of the area and its currents.
Oleg Mitvol said that although the sulfur spill doesn't present an environmental danger, the two freighters might also leak fuel oil from their tanks, adding to the pollution.
Russia, Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Georgia, and Ukraine all border on the Black Sea.
With resource reusing, environmental awareness, and creations, Jane Goodall Institute Taiwan held 2007 Hope Parade in Taiwan and lots of environmental volunteers, community colleges, and charity organizations (approximately more than 10,000 people) participated this parade walking from Taipei Municipal Hsing-an Elementary School to Ketagalan Boulevard with some materials showing the presence of five continentals.
To respond with theory of 'Roots & Shoots' by Dr. Jane Goodall, 'Roots & Shoots Program' in Taiwan has been promoted for a long time with the living quality improving and environment awareness valuing.
According to the organizer, this parade is originally founded with some communities in Xizhi, Taipei County.
To expand the global view of environment respect, this parade is chosen at Taipei City to show the particularity and differences of creatures which should be cared by common people.
In the second canonization ceremony of his papacy, Pope Benedict XVI today named four new saints.
The new saints were Rosa Venerini (1656-1728), Mother Theodore Guerin (1798-1856), Filippo Smaldone (1848-1923), and Bishop Rafael Guizar Valencia (1878-1938).
Rosa Venerini helped to establish Italy's first public schools for girls.
Mother Theodore Guerin pioneered schools and religious institutions in Indiana after emigrating from France in 1840.
One of the schools she founded, a girls academy, is still in existence a few miles west of Terre Haute.
Now named Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College, it is the oldest Catholic liberal arts college for women in the United States of America.
Italian priest Filippo Smaldone founded an order of nuns and schools for the deaf.
Bishop Rafael Guizar Valencia disguised himself to care for the wounded during the anti-clerical Mexican revolution.
In the hills of Weiswampach, Luxembourg yesterday, the 12th International WÃ¤mper Triathlon became the setting for the national championship Olympic distance (1,5 km swimming, 40 km cycling, 10 km running) triathlon for both Belgium and Luxembourg.
The Belgian championship was scheduled to take place in Vilvoorde, Belgium, but because the concentration of Salmonella bacteria in the water was too high, the Belgians moved to Luxembourg.
On Saturday, an event for children and for the handicapped took place, along with the 10 kilometre running event.
On Sunday, the Juniors and the athletes for the Promotion race started the day, followed at 1500 by the elite athletes.
Even though dark clouds hung over Weiswampach most of the afternoon, there was only a short rain shower during the cycling course.
In the men's race, Peter Croes (Belgium, Atriac team) and Dirk Bockel (Luxembourg, Celtic Diekirck team) started together for the final 10 kilometre run, but Bockel managed to outrun Croes by 23 seconds, prolonging his victory of last year.
Last year's winner, Stijn Goris from Belgium (LTTL team), came in third, followed closely by Bas Diederen from the Netherlands.
In the women's race, the top two athletes remained the same as last year; Elisabeth Liz May from Luxembourg managed to stay ahead of a pursuing group the entire race, and finished first ahead of Jessica Mayon.
Mayon secured the title of Belgian 14 Triathlon champion, in addition to the previously won Sprint Triathlon and Long Distance championships.
Mexican foreign minister Luis Ernesto Derbez says he is confident that he will become the next Organization of American States (OAS) Secretary General, and will be in the post within 4 months.
He claims to have 17 of the 18 votes needed in order to have the support of a majority within the 34 member states of the OAS.
The post became available after the previous Secretary General, Miguel Ãngel Rodriguez, served only 24 days of his term of office, before returning home to Costa Rica to face corruption charges.
The other candidates for the post are ex El Salvadorean president Francisco Flores, Guatemalan Rigoberta MenchÃº and Chilean Interior Minister JosÃ© Miguel Insulza.
Meanwhile Francisco Flores is in the Dominican Republic on the beginning of a tour of Caribbean countries drumming up support for his own candidacy.
He is being accompanied by El Salvador's deputy foreign minister Margarita Escobar in a clear sign of the importance El Salvador puts on getting their candidate into the job.
A trial date has been set in a fraud case against the Church of Scientology in France.
The date for the first hearing has been set for May 25, 2009.
If the Church is found guilty, then Scientology would be ruled illegal and would be banned from operating in France.
Prosecutors claim that the Church is engaged in illicit practices in attempts to sell their alleged self-help material.
The Church also faces charges of illegally operating as a pharmacy by illegally treating individuals with prescription medications.
The charges come from an unnamed woman, who in 1998 purchased nearly 140,000â‚£ (US$30,000) worth of Scientology self-help material which allegedly included prescription drugs.
After a few months passed, the woman said she felt like she was being scammed.
Following several complaints from other unnamed individuals and an investigation, judge Jean-Christophe Hullin ordered the Church's 'Celebrity Center', and the seven managers to be put on trial for fraud and illegally practicing as pharmacists.
On September 8, 2008 the Church released a statement following the order to stand trial saying that they felt stigmatized by the French judicial system.
The special treatment reserved for the Church of Scientology Celebrity Center raises questions about the equality of the justice system and the presumption of innocence, the Church said in a statement to the press.
This is not the first time the Church has been accused of fraud in France.
They have also been convicted of it several times, including the Church's founder, L. Ron Hubbard who was convicted of fraud in 1978.
In 1997 the Church was convicted of fraud in Lyon and 1999 in Marseille.
The 1978 convictions included Hubbard and his wife at the time, Mary Sue, both now deceased, and two other Scientologists.
The 1978 convictions included Hubbard and four Scientologists after a seven year investigation into the Church by the French authorities.
The court ruled that Hubbard and the others were using Scientology by making fraudulent claims that it was curing people from diseases to increase the financial revenue of the Church, and the ruling ordered Hubbard and the Scientologists to serve four years in prison.
However, Hubbard, along with the four Scientologists fled France, never to return, and never served a prison term.
An infectious superbug spreading in the United States is to emerge in force in Canada, doctors fear.
The bacteria have been reported popping up in day care centers and locker rooms across the U.S. 
Usually elderly or very ill hospital patients get the disease.
More than 2 million U.S. residents are infected every year, the Centers for Disease Control estimates.
An article in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) on Tuesday said that Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are spreading with alarming rapidity.
The bacteria can cause boils, pimples, or in extreme cases, flesh-eating disease, and more.
The resistant bacteria is an old foe with new fangs a pathogen combining virulence, resistance and an ability to disseminate at large, wrote Dr. John Conly, medical professor and an infectious disease specialist at the University of Calgary.
British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario are the provinces which already have had MRSA in hospitals.
A 30-year-old Calgary, Alberta man died last year of lung abscesses associated with the infection, as well as a three-month old toddler in Toronto, Ontario.
Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Alex Rios, last summer, suffered from an infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus in his leg.
Pitcher Ty Taubenheim had a similar infection on his foot.
Doctors are currently investigating some Calgary residents, who could be one of the first Canadian reports of MRSA outside of a hospital setting.
A cholera epidemic in Angola has killed over 1,200 people in the past three months.
The UN World Health Organization (WHO) says about 35,000 people have fallen ill, half the victims in the capital of Luanda, where the first cases were detected in February.
The UN say the epidemic is Angolaâ€™s worst cholera outbreak in almost two decades continues to rage on with 546 new cases and 31 deaths reported in the last 24 hours.
The medical charity Mangola, Medecines Sans Frontieres and the World Health Organisation say it is the worst outbreak recorded in the country.
Spokesman for Medecines Sans Frontiere Richard Veerman said Angola is heading for its worst ever outbreak and the situation remains very bad in Angola, he said.
It's very worrying, the official number of deaths countrywide is now more than 1,200, which is likely under-reported.
Many people will be at home and die at home and have no possibility to come to one of our treatment centres.
Cholera, an acute intestinal disease caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, causes copious, painless, watery diarrhoea that can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if treatment, including rehydration, is not given promptly.
Foreign ministers seeking to resolve Iran's nuclear crisis will meet in London today at 5P.M.
The countries sending their foreign ministers are United Kingdom, the United States, China, France, Germany and Russia.
The participating nations, with the exception of Germany, have veto powers in the UN Security Council.
The UN Security Council is also likely to meet next week to discuss further action to take against Iran, following its failure to persuade Iran to freeze its uranium enrichment program.
Many western governments suspect that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons capability.
Iran insists that the enriched uranium is meant for power generation only.
Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, and European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana have executed four rounds of negotiations on Iran's nuclear program but have failed to make a breakthrough.
Solana's representative, Cristina Gallach, stressed the current diplomatic efforts were different from a European initiative in 2004-05, which ultimately failed.
The offer of November 2004 was only one and a half pages long and only had the Europeans' signature, while the June 2006 offer has the signature of the whole Security Council and Germany, she said.
A peaceful protest in Sarajevo, lasting for several weeks so far, was ignited by a post on an online discussion board, Sarajevo-X. 
 In a post named Patriotism one user, with nickname Stolac92, expressed his dissatisfaction with Bosnia today, writing among other things on December 22 My heart hurts.
But what hurts the most is that we are quiet, we are tolerating, forgiving instead of doing something about it.
After receiving support from other forum members, the user proposed gathering in front of the Assembly building every day, starting from 5pm.
The protests started the same weekend, and had been lasting since, with couple to several dozen people attending.
Forum members decided they will not support any particular political party, but to work for Bosnia and Herzegovina without political ethnic entities and to support policies which are fair to all citizens and punish criminals.
They decided to use an open palm with a Bosnian map on it for their symbol, with word Dosta (Enough) as their slogan.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has been divided in two ethnic entities since the end of the war, the Serbian Republic and Federation of Bosniaks and Croats.
Economic progress has been slow and created disparity between people.
Since his death on Friday, tributes have continued to be paid to Sir Bobby Robson, the former manager of the English national association football team.
Silences were held at football games throughout the country over the weekend, with fans creating makeshift shrines at Newcastle United and Ipswich Town, the two clubs he was most strongly associated with.
Today Robson's widow was moved to tears when she visited the shrine created by over 50,000 fans at Newcastle.
She went on to express her gratitude to the generosity and affection of fans who have since Friday raised over Â£2,000,000 for the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation, the cancer charity founded by her late husband.
At Ipswich fans hope to rename one of the stands at Portman Road after their former manager.
Despite failing to win any major trophies with the national team, Bobby Robson was one of the most successful and best loved England managers.
His team infamously lost a penalty shoot out to West Germany for a place in the finals of the 1990 World Cup.
Robson was picked for the position of England manager after a 13 year spell at Ipswich Town enabling them to become league runners up twice and to win the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup.
Following the decision by the Football Association to not renew his contract after the 1990 World Cup, Robson won honours in club football with PSV Eindhoven, FC Porto, and FC Barcelona.
His success as a manager has been put down to a great tactical brain and the ability to get the best out of his players, not least through his respect and generosity of spirit towards them.
Robson will be remembered for his humour, his integrity, and his love of a game that he relished from childhood visits to his beloved Newcastle, a team he was later to manage.
He died at the age of 76 after a long battle with cancer, and leaves behind his wife of 54 years Elsie and their sons Andrew, Paul, and Mark.
A bomb explosion on a bus in Myanmar (alternatively Burma) has killed a 55-year-old man and left another man wounded.
The explosion occurred yesterday at 850 am local time (0220 GMT) as the bus traveled to Yangon, but state media has only posted news of the attack today.
The deceased was identified only as Khant by the New Light of Myanmar, the Burmese government-owned daily newspaper.
The article said that the injured man was 46-year-old Pa Pa and that he received a stomach injury.
The bus had 35 passengers traveling from Kyaukkyi, and was near Daik Oo, some 85 miles from its destination.
The bombing was blamed on insurgents, but it is unclear which group is responsible.
The ruling military junta is subject to attacks from a number of extremist groups opposed to its rule.
A British High Court judge has ruled that Pringles are not a potato snack and therefore not subject to a 17.5% tax.
The judge, Justice Nicholas Warren, overruled a Value Added Tax (VAT) Tribunal decision that imposed the 17.5% tax which is also applied on other potato products.
Pringles' owner Procter & Gamble had claimed at a ruling in May that Pringles do not feel, look, or taste like a crisp.
Justice Warren ruled that since Pringles are only 42% potato, it is exempt from VAT.
Ukrainian basketball player Alexander Belostenny has died at the age of 51.
Belostenny was a key player in the Soviet Union basketball team and was both a European and Olympic medallist.
He won gold in the 1979, 1981 and 1985 European championships and gold in the 1982 FIBA World Championship.
After retiring in 1994 he ran his own restaurant up in Germany, which he had acquired in 1991.
Following the announcement of his death, the Ukrainian basketball federation released a statement saying that On behalf of all fans, we want to express our deep condolences to the families and friends of the deceased.
The bright memory of Alexander M. Belostenny will always live in our hearts.
Joe Gibbs Racing driver Denny Hamlin, who qualified thirtieth, won the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 2010 AAA Texas 500 held on Sunday at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, Texas, United States.
This became his eighth win of the season, and his second at Texas Motor Speedway.
Throughout the course of the race there were nine cautions and thirty-five lead changes among fourteen different drivers.
On the final restart, Matt Kenseth caught Hamlin and passed him.
Later the same lap, Hamlin reclaimed the position, after Kenseth collided into the wall, prompting him to finish second during the race.
Joey Logano managed the fourth position in the closing laps of the race, after starting twentieth on the grid.
Greg Biffle, from the Roush Fenway Racing team, clinched the fifth position, after leading 223 laps during the race.
Kevin Harvick followed Biffle in sixth, while Clint Bowyer could only manage seventh.
Hamlin became the Drivers' championship leader with 6,325 points, thirty-three points ahead of Johnson.
The Manufacturers' Ñhampionship standings is led by Chevrolet with 249, 40 points ahead of Toyota and 91 ahead of Ford with two races remaining in the season.
Looking forward to next week, Hamlin said, I'm going to race Phoenix as if I'm 33 behind, to be honest with you.
There's no comfortable margin going into Homestead, because anything can happen.
So for me â€” Phoenix being an up-and-down race track for me â€” I've got to really be focused on practice day to get what I need, to give [crew chief] Mike [Ford] the information that I need â€” just 100 percent stay focused is all I can do.
But like I say, I'm not going to be conservative having the lead.
I'm going to want to stretch that out before we get to Homestead.
England beat Paraguay 1-0 in a bruising encounter among the shadows of the Commerzbank Arena, Frankfurt, Saturday.
In the sunshine and heat, which reached 30 degrees Celsius, it became a physical game that saw three bookings and the referee frequently blowing his whistle.
England got the perfect start scoring after just 3 minutes from a David Beckham freekick.
Swung in from the left of the field, the ball clipped the head of Paraguayan captain Carlos Gamarra on its way to the net.
Both sides looked nervous and no side got control of the midfield.
Passes were frequently misplaced and attacks from both teams lacked cutting edge.
Paraguay lost number one goalkeeper Justo Villa to an injury in the sixth minute of the game.
Missing Wayne Rooney, arguably their team's most skilled player, whose recent injury though healed had ruled him out for this match, the noisy England fans in the crowd didn't have much to sing about except the victory.
England's Swedish manager Sven-GÃ¶ran Eriksson's side had more possession but failed to score more than the one early goal.
On their part, Paraguay was unable to capitalise on a number of English defensive errors to get an equaliser.
England next face Trinidad and Tobago while Paraguay face the England manager's home nation, Sweden.
A Virgin Trains train travelling at high speed collided with a car near Copmanthorpe, Yorkshire, England, killing the car's driver.
The accident took place at approximately 2055 GMT when the Class 220221 train, travelling at close to 100mph, hit the car which was on the tracks.
The train then partially derailed but remained upright, coming to a stop further down the tracks.
The car driver is believed to have been killed instantly.
North Yorkshire Police said that the car had left the road, driven through a fence and ended up on the track.
The train was the 1425 Virgin Voyager cross-country service from Plymouth to Edinburgh Waverley, capable of speeds up to 125mph, but was deccelerating on approach into York.
The line between York and Leeds was closed for several hours, delaying other services.
Virgin Spokesman Arthur Leathley told reporters that Network Rail hoped to have three of the four lines in that section of the track operational by Tuesday morning.
A deadly hotel bombing in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, has killed at least fifteen people, including three Somali Cabinet ministers, earlier today.
The blast targeted a university graduation ceremony being attended by a number of government officials.
The Shamo Hotel was hosting a graduation ceremony for Benadir University.
Eyewitnesses reported that a suicide bomber gained access to the venue dressed as a woman, donning a full abaya and a veil.
The attacker was wearing an explosive strapped to his torso, but was not patted down by security.
The director of Median Hospital, Ali Yusuf, commented that forty people with shrapnel wounds, including students and medical doctors, have been hospitalized today.
Former Islamic Courts Union members at the scene identified the bomber, whose head and face had been completely shaven, as a member of al-Shabab, the ultra-conservative Islamist group believed to have links to al-Qaeda.
Somali Health Minister Qamar Aden Ali, Education Minister Ahmed Abdullahi Waayeel, and Higher Education Minister Ibrahim Hassan Adow were killed in the attack on Hotel.
Abdulkadir Mohamed Osman, the Somali presidency's director of information, commented on the incident.
The blast rocked inside the hotel, killing three ministers and wounding another one.
Adow served as the foreign secretary of the insurgent Islamic Courts Union when it took power in 2006.
The Somali minister for sports is also reported to be hospitalized and in critical condition.
Mohamed Mohamoud, an attending graduate of the ceremony, said that he personally saw the remains of the health minister on the ground, as well as the corpses of other government officials.
They have been studying in such a horrific environment, and today they passed away without benefiting from their education.
Two journalists, a reporter for Radio Shabelle and a cameraman with al-Arabia TV, were also found dead from the explosion.
The National Union of Somali Journalists has issued a statement condemning the attack and expressing outrage at the loss of their colleagues.
Somalia is one of the world's most dangerous places for journalists to work.
Eight have been killed in Somalia since the beginning of 2009.
Hotel Shamo is often chosen by government officials to host events and at one time was a popular lodging option for foreign journalists.
Recently-released Canadian journalist Amanda Lindhout and Australian photojournalist Nigel Brennan were staying at the hotel before their capture last year.
The hotel security staff say that they were kicked out of the room prior to the ceremony, as government security officials wanted sole handling of the event.
The government officials were attending the graduation of 43 students from the local Banadir University.
The official death toll from the blast is expected to continue to rise, with some reports indicating that more than 60 people have been found dead.
The attack is the latest in a string of incidents linking al-Shabab to common insurgent tactics used by Islamist terrorist groups in other parts of the world.
Until recently, suicide bombings were an unusual practice in Somalia.
In September, al-Shabab claimed responsibility for a bold attack on a meeting between government officials and the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia, known as AMISOM, which killed 17 peacekeepers, including the top Burundian commander.
Two vehicles containing explosives were given entry to the AMISOM base and subsequently blew up.
The rebel group is battling for control of the war-ravaged nation against the Western-backed Transitional Federal Government, led by former Islamic insurgent Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed.
Rebel groups control much of southern and central Somalia, as well as significant portions of Mogadishu.
The government is being bolstered by the continuing presence of the peacekeeping force composed of Ugandans and Burundians.
The AMISOM forces are mandated with the protection of key city sites such as the airport, seaport, and presidential palace.
Sir Richard Branson, successful British entrepreneur, better known as the founder of the Virgin brand, has made a suggestion to the next British chancellor to both save MG Rover, the largest independent manufacturer of cars in England until it collapsed this spring, and help with rapidly rising oil demand.
He wants the British government to give subsidies to the fallen car-maker so that it can be the first European producer of hybrid cars.
A 7-year old Tennessee boy who was eager to get his driver's license got an early education when he decided to take his parents pick-up truck for a joyride.
The boy, whose name was not released, remembered to wear his seatbelt and even used his turn signal when he was supposed to.
Police chasing the boy initially thought they were chasing a drunk driver.
He couldn't stay in his lane, Officer Josh Laverette said.
But when the truck came to a stop in front of a house, police saw that it was a boy, a second grader, barely 4 feet tall, behind the wheel.
He was so short he had to sit up close to the steering wheel, Laverette said.
Whenever he would brake, he would pick himself up with his left foot and stomp on the brake with his right.
When police began to talk to the boy, who managed to park in front of his own home, He said the reason he took the vehicle was because he wanted to get his license, said Laverette.
There were like probably five city cars and three county cars and a state trooper all of which were chasing the pickup, said Susan Daniel, a witness to the incident.
It blew my mind because we actually watched him put on his turn signal and turn, and we could see when he went past that he had seat belts on, Daniel said.
Then to come find out it was a child, I was really shocked.
The boy was charged with driving without a license, eluding police and leaving the scene of an accident.
He is expected to appear in juvenile court next week.
The Italian dailies La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera are reporting that US forces may not have been informed of the operation to rescue kidnapped Italian journalist, Giuliana Sgrena, in which the intelligence agent Nicola Calipari was killed by US troops.
The Italian government disputes this account, and has said that the US was fully aware of the operation on March 4.
La Repubblica is reporting that US forces were aware of Italian intelligence agent Nicola Calipari's presence, but not the specific details of his mission.
Speaking in the La Repubblica newspaper, General Mario Marioli assisted those involved in the operation in Baghdad, by obtaining a special badge for them from coalition forces upon their arrival.
However, as the deputy commander of the coalition forces in Iraq, Marioli reported that he was unaware of Calipari's purpose in Iraq, so he could not tell coalition troops on the ground the details of the Italian mission.
According to La Repubblica, Marioli reported that he had no contact with US intelligence officers prior to the shooting.
The People's Republic of China has signed an agreement with ASEAN to establish the world's largest free trade area.
Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, India and Australia are considering joining.
ASEAN members include Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei Darussalam, Singapore and Indonesia.
In the last four years China has become a major importer of oil and commodities, and a major exporter of finished goods.
China has also strengthened relationships with oil suppliers in the Middle East and Africa.
This pact lifts trade restrictions and removes tariffs from many imports and exports.
It also allows China to continue manipulating the value of its currency in its own interests.
The yuan is currently undervalued, making Chinese-made goods artificially cheap for foreign importers.
Stated in the agreement is ASEAN's intention to create a unified economy--and by implication polity--similar to the EU.
This agreement will cement China's role as the center of the South Asian regional economy, and at the same time strengthening bonds between China and other countries in the region and ease their suspicions over a growing superpower.
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun separately adopted accords with the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations, agreeing to launch the talks early next year.
Australia and New Zealand are expected to sign similar agreements with ASEAN before discussions close later Tuesday, although ASEAN remains wary of Australian Prime Minister John Howard's refusal to sign its nonaggression treaty.
Howard played down these concerns but said on record that he reserves the right to preemptively act against terrorists on foreign soil if they threaten Australia.
Pakistani officials have said that five attacks on government sites across the country have killed at least forty people.
The latest attack occurred late on Thursday at a government residential area in Peshawar.
Officials said they suspect Taliban militants for being responsible for the attacks.
Authorities said that the situation in the eastern city of Lahore was under control, following separate attacks on the country's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and two police training centers.
Gunmen with at least one suicide jacket stormed the FIA building at mid-morning.
The FIA is an agency responsible for investigating matters relating to terrorism and immigration.
Early last year, the building was the target of a suicide truck bomb that killed more than 20 people.
Reportedly, four men attacked the FIA building and initial reports are that two of them have been killed, said the provincial interior secretary, Nadeem Hassan Asif Punjab.
Soon after the assault on the FIA began, gunmen targeted two police training centers on the outskirts of Lahore.
In the suburb of Manawa, gunmen targeted a center that militants attacked earlier this year.
In the other incident, attackers with suicide jackets in Bedian climbed over a wall to gain access to the Elite Force Training Center.
It took several hours before security forces were able to gain control of all the sites.
The attacks in Pakistan's east took place hours after a suicide car bomber targeted a police station at a garrison town about an hour's drive from the northwestern city of Peshawar.
Speaking to local media, Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik said intelligence agencies had expected attacks on security sites in the country and that authorities will remain on high-alert.
He said the recent violence shows the militants want to bring the frontlines from Pakistan's violent northwest to Punjab province.
On Saturday, militants with ties to Punjab, as well as the South Waziristan tribal region, assaulted the Pakistani army's headquarters in Rawalpindi.
Pakistani intelligence officials believe the attacks are a reaction to the military's raids on South Waziristan.
The military is expected to launch a full-scale assault on Taliban militants in the region bordering Afghanistan.
England beat Kenya by 7 wickets (with 60 balls remaining) in the final Group C game in the World Cup at Beausejour Stadium, Gros Islet, Saint Lucia.
England will now advance through to the Super 8 stage.
Rain delayed the start of the match by some two hours, and therefore the match was only a 43 over game.
Sales of smartphones running the Android operating system have tripled since the beginning of 2010, according to figures released yesterday.
Market analysts GfK said that around one in every eight handsets sold in the UK between April and June 2010 on a contract is Android-powered, compared to one in 33 on average between January and March.
Last week, Samsung stepped up the marketing for its latest Android-powered device, the Galaxy S.
Other Android-powered devices include the Sony Ericsson X10 and the HTC Desire.
GfK analyst Megan Baldock said to The Guardian The figures suggest an increasing number of consumers are now asking for Android handsets by name.
A morbidly obese Ohio man died Wednesday after being found unconscious in his home several days earlier.
The man had been sitting in a chair for two years and was physically fused to it when he was discovered by two roommates, one of which was his girlfriend.
Authorities who arrived at the house in Bellaire reported seeing the man sitting amidst his own urine and feces, which were infested with maggots.
The man's skin had become attached to the recliner's cloth, said law enforcement officers, one of whom had to dispose of his uniform after responding to the home.
In order to transport the man to the hospital, officers had to carve out a portion of the wall.
Identified as 43-year-old Richard Hughes, the man died after being taken to Wheeling Hospital in West Virginia.
The residence's landlord said Hughes, weighing 348 pounds (157 kilograms), began sitting in the chair after his knees started to hurt, and refused to get up.
Hughes' girlfriend told police that she fed him because he was unable to move around.
Jim Chase, a city official, called the room where the man stayed very filthy, very deplorable and said it was unbelievable that somebody live[d] in conditions like that.
Kuwait might finance a great number of public works in East Timor, in an investment worth 500 million to 600 million dollars, the East Timorese Prime Minister said today.
JosÃ© Ramos Horta leaves today for an official visit to Kuwait.
I want to start right now the negotiations process with the Development Fund of Kuwait for the construction of great projects for East Timor's roads, bridges, harbors and airports, Ramos Horta, East Timor's Prime Minister, said.
For a project of this magnitude, to carry throughout several years, the amount of money to be spent is about 500 million to 600 million dollars or more.
We are now waiting a preliminary study made by an Indian company, paid by Kuwait, Ramos Horta added.
The East Timorese delegation is composed by the Minister of public works, Odete Victor, and the Minister of energy & mineral resources, JosÃ© Teixeira.
The visit is part of an invitation by Kuwait's Prime Minister Nasser Al-Mohammed Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, and includes meetings with the Emir Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, the crown prince Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammed Sabah Al Salem Al Sabah and representatives of the Development Fund of Kuwait.
This is the second visit to Kuwait in two years by Ramos Horta, an country with who the East Timorese Prime Minister maintains relations with several members of the royal family and of the government.
A group of 19 people, including local aborigines and Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) staff, were sprayed by a crop duster in rural Australia today.
They were walking the proposed route of a freeway bypass, looking for sites that may have significance to Aboriginal people.
The freeway bypass will be part of the Hume Highway, near Coolac in south-west New South Wales.
Police are yet to rule out that the dusting was deliberate.
We don't know whether they knew the people were there or not so we're appealing for anyone who might have witnessed the incident or knows anything about a low-flying crop-duster in the area to contact police, she said.
News available via the web does not (as of this writing) detail the effects of the spraying.
ABC Online reports that the pilot of the plane may face charges.
An explosion in a coal mine has killed at least 80 people in the city of Donetsk, Ukraine, while 20 people are reported missing.
According to reports transmitted by the local press and the Emergency Situations Department, 360 miners managed to get to the surface safely; 28 others are currently hospitalized, some with severe burns.
The Zasyadko mine is nearly 1,000 meters deep, and 457 people were in the mine when the explosion occurred at 311 am.
Initial reports suggest that the explosion was caused by methane mixing with the air in the mine.
During the afternoon, more than thirty rescue teams were found at the scene, wearing hard hats and oxygen tanks as they prepared to enter the mine.
Relatives of the victims gathered around the entrance to the mine, awaiting news of their loved ones.
The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, responded to the scene; the president of the country, Viktor Yushchenko, will visit the area this Monday.
I am grieving with all of Ukraine, declared the Ukrainian head of state.
He also criticized the government, saying that the mining industry has been a victim of insufficient efforts.
With obsolete installations and poor construction, Ukraine has been a victim of various mining accidents in the past.
According to union estimations, between 2006 and 2007 nearly 250 miners died in accidents.
Internet search king Google is preparing to provide free VoIP service â€” a technology that that makes it possible to have a telephone conversation over the internet.
Existing technology will be marketed in the Google name, something which may make all the difference.
Sources suggest that Google may firstly introduce its telephony service to users in the United Kingdom, but the actual date when the service will launch and the exact details of the plan are as yet unknown.
Google is a California-based search engine whose mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.
The largest search engine on the web, Google receives over 200 million queries each day through its various services.
Zimbabwe have defeated Australia by five wickets in Group B of the 2007 Twenty20 World Championship at Newlands Cricket Ground, Cape Town, South Africa.
Australia, who are the world champions in the 50 over format, struggled against some good fielding and bowling from Zimbabwe.
Elton Chigumbura took 3-20 and Gary Brent took 2-19 as Australia were restricted to 138 for 9 wickets after 20 overs.
Brad Hodge was Australia's top scoring batsman, scoring 35 not out, while Andrew Symonds scored 33 runs before being stumped.
Zimbabwe's batsmen started well, but Vusi Sibanda was caught behind for 23, as were Justice Chibhabha, Tatenda Taibu and Stuart Matsikenyeri to leave Zimbabwe on 70-4.
A heavy shower interrupted the innings, but play restarted and Brendan Taylor scored 60 not out as Zimbabwe reached the target with one ball remaining in a tense finish.
Drug maker Merck & Co. was found liable for a person's death concerning the use of the pain medication Vioxx, according to a jury verdict in a Texas court.
The plaintiff's case, headed by the widow of Robert Ernst, who died in 2001 of an irregular heartbeat and of clogged arteries while on the drug Vioxx, was successfully awarded $253.4 million dollars.
Vioxx was pulled from the shelves in 2004 after a study discovered it could double the risk of a heart attack or stroke if taken for longer than 1.5 years.
However, the US government agency, the FDA, decided in February of this year to allow the product back on the shelves.
Merck's stock price dropped 10% within minutes of the verdict being announced, and continued to fall hours after.
There are in excess of 4,200 other Vioxx-related lawsuits pending across the USA.
Moldovan wine producers took three silver medals at the third annual international contest of wine tasting and judging of strong alcoholic beverages, the Concours Mondial de Bruxelles 2008.
Previously, the event was held in Portugal and in Maastricht in 2007 and will held in Spain next year.
The medals went to the wines produced by the stock company Acorex Wine Holding, Amaro de la Valea Perjei 2003, Pinot Grigio Aligote Sauvignon Blanc 2005 and Pinot Noir 2005, with the last two being from the Private reserve series.
Last year's fourteenth edition of the contest, held in the Netherlands in 2007, Moldovan wines won three gold medals and three silver ones.
British MPs on the Commons Environmental Audit Committee warn Britain could face widespread electrical blackouts if new generating capacity is not added soon.
Clean and renewable generating methods will be preferred in the Government's energy review, including a return to nuclear power generation.
But the committee warned that no new nuclear power plants are expected to come online until at least 2017 with the proposed network not reaching full capacity until as late as 2030.
Meanwhile nearly a quarter of Britain's current generating capacity is scheduled to go offline by 2016, creating a shortfall described by the committee as a generation gap which could not be bridged by nuclear energy.
Very substantial investment in new generating capacity and energy efficiency will be required if the lights are to stay on, committee chairman Conservative MP Tim Yeo said.
The committee stated that an extensive building programme of new gas-fired power stations would be needed to meet the predicted shortfall.
The committee's statement drew some support from environmentalists as well as from some energy sector industries.
Friends of the Earth was cautiously cheered by the committee's commitment to energy efficiency, and support of reduced emissions.
...people understand renewables is the next big thing and we should get on with it, said Maf Smith, CEO of Scottish Renewables to BBC.
The Lower Saxony, Germany tax authority is migrating 12,000 desktops to use SuSE Linux with KDE as the desktop environment.
The systems are being migrated from Sun's Solaris x86 version 8, which has been in use at the organization since 2002.
According to Eva Brucherseifer, president of the KDE community in Germany and managing director of basysKom, the migration process in its peak phase and is porting 300 systems every day.
Interpol has issued an Orange Notice for the leader of southeast Asian Jemaah Islamiyah, Mas Selamat bin Kastari, who escaped from a detention center Wednesday.
Singapore Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng told his Parliament that a security lapse is what led to Mas Selamat's escape.
While waiting to visit his family, Mas Selamat escaped from the Internal Security Department's Whitley Road detention facility shortly after 4 PM local time after being granted permission to use the washroom.
The escape led to Mr. Wong apologizing for the incident and the beginning of an island-wide manhunt for Selamat.
When it comes to escapes, the first hours are crucial, said Jean-Michel Louboutin, Interpol's executive director of police services.
The state of Singapore has put into operation everything that's needed to be done.
It's a small country, so it's easy to cross and leave.
Selamat, a 47-year-old former bus mechanic and a father of 5, was once accused of plotting to hijack a plane and crash it into Singapore's international airport.
He is someone who presents a potential physical danger to others, but also a potential danger by organizing future bombings, Louboutin said.
Mas Selamat bin Kastari, a Singaporean national of Indonesian birth and extraction, stands 158 cm (about 5 feet 2 14 inches) tall and walks with a limp in his left leg.
After the Orange Notice was released, Mas Selamat's picture and fingerprints were released to Interpol's 186 member countries.

On Friday, May 27, 2005, 9 trains on the New York City Subway will make their final run, ending rush-hour skip-stop service on the IRT Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line north of 137th Street-City College.
During rush hours, the 9 is a skip-stop supplement to the 1, running the same route but skipping some stops in Upper Manhattan and the Bronx.
At the same time, the 1 skips other stops, which are only served by the 9 at rush hours; some stops are served by all trains.
This service pattern results in slightly faster trains, but longer waits for those going to or from skipped stations.
9 service was started on December 12, 1988, at first running during rush hours and middays.
A train, traveling at a high rate of speed, was carrying over 850 passengers when it rammed into an empty train near Rio de Janeiro.
The empty train was in the process of being moved between sets of tracks.
Officials are currently putting the death toll at eight, and at least 70 others are seriously hurt.
We have to use blowtorches to open the sides of the train cars to reach the people, said Pedro Machado, commander general of the Rio de Janeiro Fire Department.
Our priority is to give support to the survivors, the passengers trapped in the wreckage, and reduce the number of fatal victims, said Col. Souza Filho, the head of Rio de Janeiro's Civil Defense Department in an interview with the Globo TV network.
They had fractures in their arms, their faces, everywhere, said Marcos de Souza, director of the Posse Hospital in a televised interview.
He said the hospital does have a large emergency ward but they are bringing in extra personnel to treat collision victims.
Six media organisations, including Fairfax, are mounting a constitutional challenge to secret hearings in an upcoming terrorism trial in Australia.
The trial involves Sydney man Faheem Khalid Lodhi, who is charged with committing acts in preparation for a terrorist attack.
Lodhi is accused of conspiring with French terror suspect Willie Brigitte to attack Sydney's military bases and electricity supply network.
Federal Attorney-General Phillip Ruddock will issue a certificate to prevent information judged to be sensitive from reaching the public at Lodhi's trial.
The Federal Attorney-General has the powers to do this under the National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act.
The grounds for the challenge are that National Security Information legislation violates the separation of executive and judical powers, required by the Australian constitution.
Tom Blackburn, SC, counsel for the media groups mounting the challenge claims that the act allows for the federal executive to intrude into judicial matters by ordering parts of the trial are kept secret.
The challenge will be heard on 31st January 2006 by Justice Anthony Whealy of the Supreme Court of NSW.
In the course of Lodhi's trial, towards the end of December Justice Anthony Whealy ruled that evidence and pre-trial matters are to remain secret.
A federal judge ruled Monday that the controversial morning-after pill Plan B must be made available without a prescription to girls as young as 17, citing the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) willingness to concede to the Bush administration's conservative influences by setting the age limit to 18 in 2006.
Plan B, available in the United States since 1999, consists of two pills designed to prevent conception and must be taken within 72 hours of sexual intercourse.
Only since 2006 has it been available without a prescription, following lobbying from the World Health Organization and American Medical Association.
Currently the drug is only available without a prescription to women over the age of 18.
The lawsuit was filed in 2005 by the Center for Reproductive Rights.
In the ruling, the judge blasted the FDA for giving in to political considerations and delaying approval of the new age limit.
Susan F. Wood, former director of women's health at the FDA, resigned in 2005 in protest over the agency's handling of the drug.
â€œWhat happened with Plan B demonstrated that the agency was off track, and was not being allowed to do its job properly,â€ she said.
The Family Research Council, a conservative organization, said the judge had given in to political ideology promoting sexual license for teens.
The FDA says it is reviewing the ruling, which it has thirty days to comply with.
A 600 lb bomb which was found in Northern Ireland has been defused by a bomb disposal team.
The bomb was found on the side of a road near the village of Forkhill in County Armagh, Northern Ireland, close to the border with the Republic of Ireland.
It was defused by an expert bomb disposal team from the Irish Army.
The explosives were home-made and weighed 600 lb (270 kg).
It is believed that the bomb was planted there by dissident republicans.
The Police Service of Northern Ireland believed that there could have been a devastating outcome â€” and that they were also potentially targets of the bombers.
Chief Inspector Sam Cordner said The actions of terrorist criminals in planting this device in the Forkhill area put local people and police officers at significant risk.
Their target may have been the police, but they did not care who they killed or injured.
It is only through the hard work and professionalism of police officers and their military colleagues that the area has been made safe, Cordner said.
20 people had to evacuate their homes while the bomb was safely defused.
Authorities took the device and will conduct a forensic examination.
A Southern Sudan Air Connection aircraft has crashed today in Southern Sudan, killing over a dozen people, including the area's defence minister.
There are conflicting reports on how many people were on board and how many died in the Bahr Gazal crash, but at least twenty people were on board.
Some sources suggest nineteen fatalities and two survivors, and others say there were 26 deaths and no survivors; it should be noted that if either of these were correct then there were more than twenty on board.
Lieutenant General Dominic Dim Deng, the area's defence minister, is confirmed to be dead and it is thought at least 19 military officials are now deceased.
The plane had been rented from a charter company and was carrying a delegation of leaders from the (former rebel) Sudan People's Liberation Movement from Wau to the capital Juba, said Luka Mariak, spokesman for the Souther Sudan president Salva Kiir.
This makes the journey around 450 kilometres (290 miles), with the plane crashing in a flat region 375 kilometres (around 220 miles) from Juba.
The United Nations said that the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) had dispatched a helicopter to assist the emergency response effort.
The UN also said that the aircraft was a Beechcraft 1900 and that they would fly in government officials and aviation experts to conduct an investigation.
Ashraf Jehangir Qazi, UNMIS's Secretary-General's Special Representative, offered his condolences to the government on behalf of both UNMIS and th UN as a whole.
Kiir said in a press conference Twenty-one passengers were killed and either two or three crew members.
Two engines failed and there was nothing the pilot could do.
Justin Yak and his wife are also confirmed to be dead.
Yak was the minister for cabinet affairs until a 2007 reshuffle left him removed from office.
He was an adviser to the president at the time of his death.
Bodies were flown into Juba Airport were relatives waited for hours for news.
UNMIS is expected to fly the bodies on to their nearby airfield, to which there is no public access.
The disaster is thought to be an accident caused by mechanical trouble.
The pilot had contacted Air Traffic Control (ATC) to report engine problems and requested permission to conduct an emergency landing at nearby Rumbek.
In proceedings by the Guantanamo military commission at the United States Guantanamo Bay Naval Base on Monday, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four alleged co-conspirators stated that they will confess and plead guilty to the charges they face in the planning and execution of the September 11 attacks in 2001.
The defendants announced their intentions in court, with Stephen R. Henley reading their filing.
He also said it was our earnest desire to admit guilt and said he wanted the proceeding to end because I do not trust Americans.
Mohammed also expressed displeasure that it took over a month for the court to address his filing requesting an immediate hearing session to announce our confessions.
In court he said, I don't know â€” are the military commissions using carrier pigeons or what speaking in English.
The judge would not accept pleas from Binalshibh and al-Hawsawi, ordering mental competency hearings for the two.
Al Hawsawi objected and told the judge he decided to plead guilty with all my complete mental capacity and voluntarily.
However, Mohammed told the judge they would not enter their pleas without Binalshibh and al-Hawsawi, We want everyone to plead together.
After the competency evaluations, another hearing will be held, where the five may enter their pleas.
Presiding Officer Stephen Henley asked for briefs from prosecutors on whether the military commission can accept a plea of guilty to a capital offense.
Monday's hearing was unusual in that, in addition to the press, the families of five 911 victims were also in attendance.
The Global Polio Eradication Initiative has announced its goal to eradicate Polio from Asia in 2005.
The 16 year old private-public project aims to add Poliomyelitis to the list of childhood diseases which have been eliminated.
The World Health Organization, Rotary International, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and UNICEF are leading the Initiative and coordinating a series of overlapping immunization campaigns in the region.
In 2004 Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan cut their number of Polio cases by 45%.
In 2005 the goal is to cut the number of cases by 100%.
The three countries are the last in Asia to have endemic polio, and the disease is confined to a small number of regions within the country.
Only 186 cases were reported in 2004, down from 336 the previous year.
The United States military Strategic Command (STRATCOM) has said that the 'fireballs' spotted over areas of Texas in the United States on Sunday February 15, are not related to the collision of a U.S. and Russian satellite in space.
According to spaceweather.com, NASA says the object was a meteor.
There is no correlation between the debris from that collision and those reports of re-entry, said STRATCOM military spokeswoman Major Maj. Regina.
It's a natural meteor, definitely, said Bill Cooke, an astronomer at NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office.
On Tuesday, February 10, the American civilian communications satellite Iridium 33, launched in 1997, and the defunct Russian military communications satellite Kosmos-2251, launched in 1993, collided over Siberia.
On Friday February 13, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued an alert for falling debris from the satellites, following reports of explosions and earthquakes along with flashes in the sky in Jackson and Louisville, Kentucky.
Then again on Sunday, calls to 9-1-1 began to come in to Williamson County, Texas sheriff's office around 1230 p.m. (Central time) that burning debris and fireballs were seen falling from the sky onto parts of Austin, Houston, Waco and San Antonio.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported to local law enforcement on Friday that these events are being caused by falling satellite debris.
These pieces of debris have been causing sonic booms, resulting in vibrations felt by some residents, as well as flashes of light across the sky, said the NOAA on Friday in an public information alert posted on their website.
The FAA says the burning material over Texas is not related to this alert.
Residents in Texas reported their homes and windows shaking and large explosions on Sunday morning.
After a search of several areas, the Williamson county sheriff's office reported that no debris or impact sites were found.
Earlier unconfirmed reports had said the debris could have been the result of a small plane exploding.
There was previous speculation was that the object in Texas could have been a meteor.
Doctor Marco Ciocca, a professor at Eastern Kentucky University told WKYT on Sunday that it's too early for the debris from the satellites to be reentering the planet's atmosphere.
[It could] be months before any of the satellite wreckage enters the earth's atmosphere.
It will either vaporize or stay in orbit for some time before falling into earth's atmosphere.
However, the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) said on February 12 that the debris could have taken 10 days or less to reenter over portions of the planet.
Within 24 hours of the collision, the U.S. space tracking system had identified 600 pieces of debris.
This large number suggests that the collision must have been relatively head-on.
If the two satellites hit head-on, rather than a glancing blow, the energy of the collision would completely disintegrate both satellites into clouds of debris, said the UCS in a statement on their website who also added that the collision took place in the same region of space where China destroyed a defunct Chinese weather satellite with an anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon in 2007.
That January 2007 test created a massive amount of debris.
There have been at least eight major satellite collisions since 1991.
The satellites, both of which had a mass in excess of 450 kilograms, and were traveling at approximately 17,500 miles per hour (28,150 kmhour), collided 491 miles (790 km) above the earth.
Scientists say the explosion caused by the collision was massive.
They are still trying to determine just how large the crash was and how the earth will be affected.
The results of a plotting analysis will be posted to a public website.
New research published in the journal Nature Medicine has shown a link between a faulty gene and migraines.
Scientists hope that this discovery will lead to improved pain management treatments for sufferers, with possible benefits for pain treatment generally.
The breakthrough involves a gene known as TRESK, thought to control the brain's reaction to pain if it is defective, then many normal activities and actions will be painful.
Migraine sufferers (thought in the United Kingdom to number about eight per cent of men and eighteen per cent of women) often complain that light, noise and touch cause pain.
TRESK can potentially be affected by drugs that would change the point at which it reports pain, which would alleviate the suffering of those with migraines.
The study involved scientists from the Medical Research Council Functional Genomics Unit at the University of Oxford and from Canada.
They looked at the DNA of 110 people with migraine and members of their family, and found that TRESK was a major component in migraines.
One of the Oxford researchers, consultant neurologist Zameel Cader, described it as a once in a generation find and said that it could potentially lead to a treatment for pain in general.
Before this study, no genes had been directly linked to migraines, although parts of the DNA that raised the general risk had been found.
Migraines are described by the World Health Organisation as a major worldwide cause of disability.
In Britain, it is estimated that migraines affect 20 per cent of the population, with about 190,000 migraines occurring daily and over 25 million lost days from work every year.
Lee Tomkin, director of a sufferers' charity, Migraine Action, described the news as fantastic and genuinely a really great step forward.
Professor Peter Goadsby from the Migraine Trust termed it a novel direction to consider new therapies in this very disabling condition.
With studies suggesting the existence of life on Mars, the new system may soon see implementation.
Paraguay beat Trinidad and Tobago in a match that had no effect on the qualifiers through to the round sixteen of the Fifa World Cup, Tuesday.
Paraguay edged the game from start to finish and got a goal in each half.
Trinidad and Tobago could manage just two shots to trouble Aldo Bobadilla in the Paraguay net.
Kelvin Jack, who started his first Fifa World Cup game, made seven saves.
After 25 minutes Jack was a bystander when Roberto Acuna's freekick was driven hard into the box.
Jack's central defender Brent Sancho inadvertently directed the ball goalbound with his head.
The goal that sealed the game for the South Amercians was scored six minutes from time by Nelson Cuevas after he had exchanged passes with Roque Santa Cruz.
The game was notable for being the last appearance for Carlos Gamarra, 35, for his national side.
After three games the Group B table was topped by England with seven points and then Sweden with five points with Paraguay and Trinidad and Tobago going out of the competition.
The Common Council requested on Tuesday that a picture be found on what many thought was the site of a previous hotel.
The Proposed Elmwood Village Hotel would be placed on the intersection of Elmwood and Forest.
It was suspected by residents and business owners in the area that hotel once stood in the same spot.
The Elmwood Village hotel is a proposed development by Savarino Construction Services Corp.
After some research, a freelance journalist writing for Wikinews was able to determine that there was never a hotel on the proposed Elmwood Village Hotel site.
However; there was a temporary hotel located on the northeast corner of Elmwood and Forest.
Buffalo was the host of the Pan-American Exposition from May 1 until November 2, 1901.
It was a fair designed to feature the latest in technology, including electricity.
There was a midway, athletic events, and had African, Eskimo, and Mexican villages.
However; what is likely the most famous event that took place at the exposition was the assassination of then President William McKinley on September 6, 1901.
He was shot by Leon Czolgosz just outside the Temple of Music and died eight days later while in the home of John Milburn on Delaware Avenue in Buffalo.
Just a short time later, Theodore Roosevelt was inaugurated on September 14, 1901 at the Wilcox House on Delaware Avenue in Buffalo.
During that time several hotels and rooming houses were built around the exposition including The Elmwood at 717 Elmwood, the Hotel Elmhurst at Forest and Lincoln Parkway, Hotel Gibbs 1005-1021 Elmwood, the R. Palmerton Merritt at 441 Forest and The Norman at 422 Forest.
Probably the most famous hotel that was built during the exposition was the Statler's Pan-American Hotel built by Ellsworth Milton Statler.
A freelance journalist writing for Wikinews has obtained the only known reproduction photo of the hotel [pictured at the top].
The hotel stood on the northeast corner of Elmwood and Forest Avenues in Buffalo, had 2,100 sleeping rooms and accommodations for 5,000.
At the time, the Statler was the largest hotel [based on the number of rooms] ever constructed.
It was three stories high, plastered on the inside, made mostly of wood and was covered with ornamental staff on the outside, which made it semi-fireproof.
Every room was an outside room and was well lighted and ventilated.
It was located within one block of the exposition's main entrance.
The Statler was built for only one thing, the exposition.
Work began in 1900 and finished just before the beginning of the exposition.
When the exposition ended in November, the hotel was taken down.
Maps from 1894 show that there was no hotel, let alone any buildings or houses on the intersection.
However; research did show that the homes 1119-1121 Elmwood, the buildings that would be demolished to build the Elmwood Village Hotel, were built sometime before 1915 but were not on the intersection prior to 1902.
Based on research conducted at the Buffalo Historical Society, it was concluded that between the years of 1890 and 1902, no other major hotel existed in the area.
In fact, research had shown that almost every hotel built in the area, existed only during the time of the exposition.
Research also indicated a hotel or a rooming house at 1089 Elmwood around 1901-1903.
The only known name of the hotel was the John C. Hill Hotel.
The hotel was in the house now called the Atwater House.
The house was the first house to be built on the east side of the block.
The Atwater House is currently vacant and owner Pano Georgiadis wants to demolish it to expand his restaurant.
The house was built by 1894 and the original owner and builder of the house is currently unknown.
Its earliest known occupant was Edward Atwater who in 1862 founded the oil refinery company of Atwater & Hawes in Buffalo.
The site of this company was recently uncovered in the Canal District during an archeological dig.
At the moment, current research does not show any connection between the two men.
Numerous cities throughout Texas, United States have begun broadening their efforts to fight mosquito populations, in an effort to reduce transmission of the sometimes-lethal West Nile virus.
Officials in Dallas county have declared a public health emergency.
Officials there have requested use of five planes, intended to spray most of North Dallas, as well as other sections of the city.
Tim Whitley, a city official in Malakoff, told Wikinews his city has begun using a pesticide specialist to spray two times weekly.
According to Whitley, certain atmospheric conditions, such as wind speed and humidity, must be right before the large scale treatments can occur.
He explained two treatments per week is more often than usual for the city.
With the concerns in Dallas, we're taking it seriously, Whitley added.
Even in the drier climate found in Abilene, mosquitos recently tested were carrying the virus.
As a result, that city has increased its pesticide treatments.
Media sources indicate well over 80 cases of West Nile virus have been reported this year in Dallas county alone.
A top-ranking Dallas county official told media he views the problem with serious concern.
There have been nine cases of West Nile virus in the Houston region, with one of those resulting in death.
A New Jersey woman who is a former resident of Lubbock told media earlier this month she'd contracted the virus and believed she'd been bitten while visiting Austin.
About 60 percent of West Nile cases in the U.S. happen in Texas.
Historically, there have been some objections raised over aerial spraying and the potential health hazards distributing such chemicals may pose.
A California study, however, showed evidence that in areas where aerial spraying occurred, infection was six times less likely to occur.
The earliest cases of the virus appeared in the U.S. in the late 1990s.
Initial results gave Afghan President Hamid Karzai more than the 50% of votes necessary to re-elect him in the country's recent presidential elections.
However, after a month of speculation about vote-rigging, officials from the United Nations-backed Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) have discounted ballots from 210 polling stations.
European Union observers have claimed that as many as one in four votes may be in doubt.
The Afghanistan ECC has published a report about their investigation into allegations which emerged after the polls two months ago.
The EEC has stated that there was clear and convincing evidence of fraud at polling stations throughout the country.
As the ECC reports to the Independent Election Commission (IEC) no official announcement has been made yet, although by law the IEC is obliged to accept the EEC findings; however foreign diplomats have suggested that the IEC may not accept the findings.
President Karzai has refused to accept the investigation's findings, which reduce his share of the vote from around 55% to under 50%, leading to what Mohammad Moin Marastyal, one of the campaign team members, describes as deadlock.
Marastyal claims that the EEC deliberately altered the facts to force a runoff.
Effort has been made to lower Karzai's vote to below 50 per cent, he stated.
The 2008 Taipei Game Show, organized by the Taipei Computer Association (TCA), ended on Monday, and was different from shows of past years.
This could be seen in the gaming population, industry, and exhibition arrangements.
The Indonesian province of Aceh was struck by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake at 308 PM local time (808 AM GMT).
The epicentre was 319 km (198 miles) off the coast of Sumatra, close to the island of Simeulue.
At least three people have been killed and several buildings have been damaged.
The same region was hit by an earthquake in 2004, that triggered a tsunami.
According to local citizens the quake lasted about one minute and was felt in Banda Aceh, the province capital, approximately 300 km (185 mls) away, also in Meulaboh and Gunung Sitoli on Nias island.
The U.S. Geological Survey, that reported the earthquake, says that no local tsunami warning has been issued.
Minutes after the quake hit, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a warning that parts of the Sumatran coast were at risk of a possible tsunami but was later cancelled.
Japan's meteorological agency said India's Andaman and Nicobar island chain was also at risk.
Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency recorded at least two aftershocks about 20 minutes after the first tremors, one measuring 5.5 and the other 5.3 on the Richter scale.
Budi Waluyo, an official at the National Meteorology and Geophysics Agency said the quake occurred about 30 kilometres beneath the ground.
The US Geological Survey measured the quake at 7.6 on the Richter scale.
The quake has no tsunami potential because it's happening under the ground, not the sea, Waluyo said.
It just wasn't their day for the two baseball teams on either side of the Straight, as China Stars and Uni-President Lions were both eliminated in a route at the Konami Cup 2007.
The final of Konami Cup will take place between SK Wyverns and Chunichi Dragons.
Lead poisoning has taken the lives of at least 163 individuals in the northern Nigerian state of Zamfara in recent weeks.
Sometime during March residents of remote villages began illegally mining gold in areas of high lead concentration.
There have been a total of 355 reported cases, setting the fatality rate at 46%.
According to Henry Akpan, chief epidemiologist at Nigeria's Ministry of Health, 111 of the 163 recorded deaths have been children, many only several years old.
Akpan further said that officials had seen young children playing in contaminated water located near the mining sites.
The government had found through their yearly immunization program that there were almost no children living in the villages of Zamfara.
Adults from the area reported that the children had died of malaria.
However, after an investigation, health officials concluded that there was an abnormally large amount of lead circulating in the villagers' bodies.
Nigeria's government has requested assistance from international organizations, including the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in averting a widespread outbreak.
The Ministry has meanwhile organized two camps for villagers suffering from the poison.
The South African government has reported that former President Nelson Mandela has been discharged from a hospital in Pretoria, where he was hospitalised December 8. 
Mandela received hospital treatment for gallstones and a lung infection.
Presidential spokesperson Mac Maharaj said Mandela will undergo home-based high care at his Houghton home until he recovers fully.
Mandela was hospitalised for eighteen days, his longest hospitalisation since 1990, when he was released from prison after 27 years.
Current president Jacob Zuma visited Mandela in hospital this past weekend.
Zuma visited Mandela again on Christmas, as did Graca Machel, Mandela's wife.
Mandela has been hospitalised three times since the start of last year.
In January 2011, Mandela received hospital treatment for an acute respiratory infection.
Work at a Robben Island limestone quarry, where he was imprisoned for sixteen years during South Africa's Apartheid, damaged his eyes and lungs.
During the 1980s, while still a prisoner on Robben Island, he developed .
Maharaj, once a political prisoner alongside Mandela during Apartheid, expressed thanks for public and media support and allowing Mandela privacy.
On behalf of the government, Maharaj also asked for a continuation of the privacy in order to allow for the best possible conditions for full recovery.
According to the Bureau of Meteorology, (BOM) 2005 was the hottest year since reliable, widespread temperature observations became available in 1910.
Data collected by the Bureau show Australia's annual mean temperature for 2005 was 1.09Â°C above the standard 1961-90 average.
The Bureau of Meteorology says the result is more evidence of climate change.
The Bureau's Blair Trewin said We've seen things like the general retreat of the winter snow line.
We've seen a marked decrease in the frequency of frost, especially in inland Queensland, Dr Trewin said.
We've seen an increase in the number of extreme hot days.
All the projections we have from climate models we would expect to see continued warming through the 21st century, he said.
Numbers like this ... are another piece of evidence that climate change is real and it's a real issue.
Despite unseasonably cool weather in the South West of Western Australia, 2005 was a hot year over most of the nation, with the Northern Territory (NT) bearing the brunt.
The NT area-average maximum temperature was 1.45Â°C above the long-term mean, the largest anomaly of any state or territory.
The Bureau says that while these temperature departures may seem relatively small, a 1Â°C increase in mean temperatures is equivalent to many southern Australian towns shifting northward by about 100km.
All States and Territories, apart from Victoria and Tasmania, recorded 2005 mean temperatures amongst their top two warmest years on record.
The only region recording a cooler than normal year was a coastal strip of Western Australia extending from Cape Leeuwin to Carnarvon.
Australia's previous warmest years on record were influenced by significant El NiÃ±o events, say the Bureau.
However, no such event occurred in 2005, making the record warmth even more unusual.
Since 1979, all but four years have been warmer than average in Australia.
Australian temperatures have increased by approximately 0.9ÂºC since 1910 - consistent with global warming trends.
Scientific studies have linked global and Australian temperature increases to the enhanced greenhouse effect.
The early months of 2005 were also very dry over much of Australia with the January-May period being the 2nd driest on record.
Australia's area-averaged rainfall is calculated from a network of around 5000 rainfall stations.
Observations from this network reveal that, when compared to historical records, Tasmania was the wettest State in 2005, while Queensland and Western Australia were the driest.
Over the New Year bushfires have caused havoc in many parts of Australia, with houses, farm stock devastated.
Thousands of hectares of bushland and farmland have been burnt out.
Environmentalists say the weather is a precursor of things to come 2005 gave us a little taste of what life will be like if we fail to tackle climate change, Greenpeace's Catherine Fitzpatrick said.
The extreme heat and bushfires of New Year's Day 2006 showed that it isn't going to be fun.
If action isn't taken soon to avoid catastrophic climate change, Australians will have John Howard to blame for failing to act when he had the chance.
Ms Fitzpatrick said the Federal Government was as beholden to the coal and aluminium industries as the Japanese government was to whaling companies, and with far more devastating impacts.
Today's figures should spur our Environment Minister ... to real action â€“ ratify Kyoto, quit coal and move towards clean, renewable energy, Ms Fitzpatrick said.
Federal Environment Minister Ian Campbell said he recognised climate change was the biggest modern-day environmental challenge.
I think that climate change is alarming, he said on ABC radio.
I regard climate change as the number one environmental challenge â€¦
These figures add to the weight of evidence that climate change is real and it's a problem that the world needs to work together to seek to solve.
Australia and the United States are the only developed nations to have refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol, which calls on countries to cut greenhouse emissions by 5.2 per cent below 1990 levels by 2012.
The Government argues Kyoto will not work because it does not commit developing nations to reducing emissions.
It only covers just over a third of the countries of the world and ... we need something that includes all countries of the world, said Senator Campbell.
Many regions across the globe also reported an exceptionally warm year.
According to a preliminary estimate released by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the global mean temperature for 2005 was about 0.48Â°C above normal, putting 2005 amongst the four warmest years globally since records commenced in 1861.
The aftershock reached a magnitude of 5.9 with the epicenter located nineteen kilometers west of Pichilemu, according to the University of Chile Geological Survey (UCGS).
However, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported that it reached a magnitude of 5.8; had a depth of 8,5 kilometers; and that the epicenter was located 65 kilometers at the southwest of San Antonio, ValparaÃ­so; 100 kilometers at the west of Rancagua, O'Higgins 105 kilometers at the northwest of CuricÃ³, Maule and; 135 kilometers at the southwest of Santiago, Metropolitan Region.
United States glam metal band Poison is suing Capitol Records and EMI Music Marketing over an alleged breach of contract.
Poison claim the two companies have underpaid them royalties for years.
The band claims Capitol miscategorized various record sales and miscalculated every possible expense since the 1980s.
They say when attempting to check company records they received no co-operation and are now asking a judge to order the firms to reveal their records so the band can determine how much they are owed.
New signing Laurent Robert and the return of Greg Sutton were not enough for Toronto F.C. as they fell 4-1 to D.C. United in Washington.
Early goals from Luciano Emilio and Santino Quaranta left Toronto in an uphill battle for the rest of the match.
The hill only became bigger in the 22nd minute when Kevin Harmse put in a hard challenge on Gonzalo Peralta and was subsequently sent off.
Marcelo Gallardo then made it 3-0 for the home side in the 52nd minute.
Quaranta crossed the ball and Gallardo was wide open to smash the ball into an open net.
Jaime Moreno capped off the scoring for D.C. in the 78th before Edu opened Toronto's MLS account with his first goal of the season.
The loss leaves Toronto at 0-2-0 on the season, while DC pick up their first win after losing their opener.
DC now travel to play Real Salt Lake, while Toronto will visit David Beckham and the L.A. Galaxy.
Between the debate and the first voting round BoboÅ¡Ã­kovÃ¡ withdrew her candidacy, citing a lack of support for her.
Thai-Japanese Bangkok Youth Center, Bangkok â€” Wikinews interviewed Georgia Inglis, of the Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team, known as the Gliders.
The Gliders are in Bangkok, Thailand, for the Asia-Oceania Zone Wheelchair Basketball Championships, which are being held at the Thai-Japanese Bangkok Youth Center.
They are hoping to qualify for the World Championships, which are being held in Toronto, Canada, in June next year.
Inglis is one of two new players in the team.
Wikinews caught up with her before the Gliders' match against China.
The United States 2008 federal deficit has reached a record high, US$454.8 billionâ€”more than double last year's deficit.
Financial experts believe that next year, the deficit will reach over $700 billion, while the National Debt Clock has recently run out of digits to record over $10 trillion in national debt.
The deficit is now equivalent to 3.2% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the United States, with the government's total income being 17.8% of GDP, and total outlays being equivalent to 21% of GDP.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson blamed the deficit on the housing market, related markets, and slow growth.
He said the news would reinforce the need to not only address short-term challenges, but pursue policies that promote economic growth and fiscal responsibility, and address entitlement reform.
Democrats like Senator Kent Conrad, however, placed the blame on President Bush's failed policies.
The reality is that the next president will be inheriting a fiscal and economic mess of historic proportions, said Conrad, adding that it will take years to dig our way out.
Another Democrat, House Budget Committee Chairman John Spratt, also blamed the Bush administration.
The eight years of this administration will include the five biggest budget deficits in history, he said.
The resulting debt will be passed to our children and grandchildren.
Jim Nussle, director of the Office of Management and Budget said that he believes that the deficit will start to decline.
The bipartisan stimulus bill and the slow economy are the primary reasons for the increase in deficit as reflected in this year's budget results.
This increase reinforces the need to adopt and maintain policies that promote economic growth and fiscal responsibility, including entitlement reform and pro-growth tax policies.
I am confident the economy can return to stronger growth with a declining deficitâ€”after working through current challenges if Congress limits wasteful and excessive spending.
The special TADA court hearing the 1993 Mumbai blasts case began delivering its verdict today.
Four members of the Memon family, Yakub, Essa, Rubina and Yusuf, were found guilty of conspiring and abetting acts of terrorism and also having contacts with underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, and now face between 5 years and life in prison.
The judge decided to acquit three other Memons, Suleiman, Hanifa and Raheen, giving them the benefit of the doubt.
Yakub, younger brother of prime accused Ibrahim Mushtaq 'Tiger' Memon, was also convicted of possessing unauthorised arms.
The rest of the accused, including Bollywood star Sanjay Dutt, will hear the judgements in their cases over a period of four weeks.
After hearing the court's ruling against him, Yakub lost his temper, hurling abuses at the judge and accusing him of making terrorists out of innocents.
After the blasts, which killed over 250 people in 13 explosions across the city, the Memon family fled to Dubai, and then Pakistan.
Except Tiger and his brother Ayub, however, the rest of them returned to India in 1994, and were arrested by the CBI.
Since then, Yakub has been in custody and has, according to his lawyer Subhash Kanse, been undergoing treatment for depression.
England have beaten West Indies by five wickets in the second Twenty20 international of the West Indies tour of England at The Oval, London, England.
England's victory tied the two match series 1-1 after West Indies won the first Twenty20 yesterday.
Chris Gayle got the West Indies off to a good start with 61 runs off 37 balls, but the England bowlers and fielders restricted their score to 169-7 after 20 overs despite some big hits from Marlon Samuels.
In reply, England faltered, losing three wickets in 14 balls followed by the dismissal of Kevin Pietersen for 19.
However Owais Shah scored 55 to help England past the target.
The tour now moves on to a series of three One-Day International matches starting on 1st July.
Earlier in the tour, England won a four match Test series 3-0.
London, England â€” Yesterday Wikinews had the opportunity to tour the Ottobrock wheelchair repair workshops at the Paralympic Village in London.
It is one of a network of workshops at every Paralympic venue.
They are run by Ottobrock, which has been repairing wheelchairs at the Paralympics since 1988.
The workshop opened on August 22 and will remain until September 10.
They liken themselves to the pit crew of motor sport â€” except that they have no idea what sort of equipment they will have to work with.
The store room contains 15,000 spare parts, with everything from spare carbon fibre running blades to spare tyres â€” over 2,000 of them.
They stock Ottobrock parts and their competitors' too, as they have no idea what will arrive at the workshop next.
Athletes from around the world bring in all manner of equipment.
The prosthetic technicians have to deal with everything from flat tyres to broken spokes to full-scale rebuilds.
They frequently collaborate on determining how best to effect a repair.
The objective is to get the wheelchair repaired and back in service as soon as possible.
Those for wheelchair basketball and rugby have cambered wheels so they can spin around.
Ottobrock has a welding workshop where frames are repaired; the teams' equipment managers understandably cannot bring such heavy equipment with them to the games, so they rely on the workshops.
When a repair job is required, it is often required in a hurry.
At the Turkey vs United States game, a chair was repaired during the match.
In addition to wheelchairs, the workshops handle all manner of work with prostheses.
The Chinese Boccia team brought in its power chairs to have the electronics adjusted.
In that sport, having the controls working perfectly is all-important.
Close to 6,500 civilians have been killed and many thousands more wounded in the past three months during heavy fighting in Sri Lanka, according to a report by the United Nations.
Earlier this year, the army launched a crackdown on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (Tamil Tigers) to oust them from their territory in the northeastern part of Sri Lanka, which the rebels have occupied for several years.
The rebels have now been forced back to a small coastal strip, where about fifty thousand people have been trapped after the area was evacuated of 100,000 people.
Thangamuttu Sathyamurthi, a government health official in the war zone, reported that people were dying of starvation, and that there was a large deficit of medicine and food.
According to the medical relief group MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (Doctors without Borders), many of the people who had fled the conflict zone had gunshot and blast wounds.
The government has accused the Tamil Tiger rebels of using civilians as human shields, a claim that the rebels deny.
The rebels have accused the Sri Lankan army of randomly shelling civilian areas.
The U.N. says that the rate of civilian deaths in the country has risen sharply.
On average, 33 civilians were killed per day at the end of January.
The number has now increased to an average 116 per day.
Quarterback Brett Favre of the Green Bay Packers broke Dan Marino's record for career touchdown passes on Sunday, throwing number 421 to receiver Greg Jennings with 456 left in the first quarter.
The recordbreaking pass was a 16-yard slant route, and Favre had to throw a bullet to complete it.
Though the game was being played at the Metrodome, even the Minnesota Vikings fans stood and applauded as Favre celebrated with his teammates.
After the announcement of the record was made, a taped message from Marino played on the Jumbotron.
I'd like to take a minute to congratulate you on breaking one of the great records in sports.
I loved holding the touchdown record for the past 13 years, but if someone was going to break it, I'm glad it was someone like you, who has always competed at the highest level and always played only to win, said Marino.
Over the past 17 years, you've been a credit to the Packers, and to the National Football League and to the sport that we all love so much.
This historic event came just two weeks after Favre broke John Elway's record for career wins by a quarterback, defeating the New York Giants for win number 149.
The Green Bay icon also holds the records for career completions and consecutive games started by a quarterback, which continued on Sunday at 241.
Later in the second quarter of today's game, Favre threw the 8,359th pass of his career, eclipsing another of Marino's records.
When asked about the record after the game, a subdued Favre said,It's just a number.
I'm more proud of the fact that we won this game...
I'm pleased it's over, and I'm honored.
To play this long, I think, is a special thing and to achieve this is, uh, very special,.
He added that, in his mind, Dan Marino is still the best quarterback of all time.
ETA (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna), a separatist group based out of the Basque region of northern Spain, announced in a recorded and written message that it would end its armed campaign for independence, instead focusing on political means for achieving its goals.
In the video sent to the BBC, ETA stated that, while the autonomy framework enshrined in the Spanish constitution is not the way to satisfy the wishes of the Basque people, the organisation was committed to finding a democratic solution to the conflict.
Several analysts have suggested that this most recent ceasefire is based on ETA's tactics causing their support in the Basque region to plummet.
Author Paddy Woodworth found in a recent trip to the region that the group's actions had made former supporters of the movement believe ETA was politically finished.
The BBC's Sarah Rainsford said that ETA is at the weakest point in its 51-year history and that the ceasefire may just be a ploy to disguise that weakness.
The group, which is listed as a terrorist organization by the European Union and the United States, have declared ceasefires several times before, which have all ended in a resumption of violence.
The most recent ceasefire, in 2006, led to peace talks between the group and the Spanish government, but they were interrupted by a car-bombing at Madrid's Barajas Airport.
The bombing was frowned upon by all involved in the peace process, including other Basque separatist parties in the region.
On Friday, all six major American television networks; ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, WB, and UPN, along with most PBS stations, united in a rare show of solidarity to air a one hour charity concert called Shelter from the Storm A Concert for the Gulf Coast.
The concert aired live at 8pm in the Eastern time zone and 7pm in the Central time zone and on tape-delay in the Mountain and Pacific time zones.
It was also shown on the Internet and many cable networks such as USA, Bravo and G4.
The show was produced by Joel Gallen, the same man behind the September 11th tribute concert America A Tribute to Heroes.
The show was not censored for political statements but was for obscenities.
Last week, rapper Kayne West made a remark on an NBC charity show A Concert for Hurricane Relief, in which West claimed that George Bush doesn't care about black people., which caused controversy.
Throughout the concert there were notable acts, such U2 performing One with Mary.
Another moment was Garth Brooks, Trisha Yearwood and the house band from The Late Show with David Letterman doing a cover of John Fogerty's Who'll Stop The Rain.
Donations were being solicited for the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army.
Telecom company AT&T provided toll-free calling and 10 call centers for the event and MCI provided volunteers from their call centers.
BET also held a charity concert called S.O.S (Saving OurSelves), a half-hour before cutting to the main one.
MTV, MTV Overdrive, VH1 and CMT will air a charity show Saturday called ReAct Now Music & Relief.
Ian Alleyne, host of Trinidad TV show Crime Watch, has been charged with crimes under the Sexual Offences Act after a tape purporting to show a mentally ill teenage girl being raped was allegedly broadcast last year.
The footage allegedly was on-air thrice last October and triggered multiple complaints to police.
 Caribbean Communications Network's (CCN's) channel TV6 is jointly charged under the same act as Alleyne, as well as under the Telecommunications Act. 
Alleyne has been hospitalised following his arrest, owing to chest pains.
He is due to go before a magistrate, and cannot receive bail until he does so.
Police had visited CCN offices in Port of Spain twice last year seeking the tape.
Alleyne issued a message to The Trinidad Express criticising the decision not to grant him bail until he appears in court.
He said it is really a sad state of affairs on the part of the police.
What have I done that they have seen it fit to ensure that I'm only granted bail before a magistrate
Mexico's electoral court has unanimously rejected claims of massive fraud in the July 2nd presidential election and reported that the partial recount ordered at the end of last month has not changed the original result of a narrow victory for conservative candidate Felipe Calderon of the National Action Party (PAN).
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party (PRD), continues to insist that the election was rigged and has vowed to continue fighting the result.
Lopez Obrador has rejected the ruling and suggested forming a rival parallel government.
There is no legal avenue to appeal the court's ruling, in except of the 39th article of the Mexican Constitution which states The sovereignty of the state resides on the citizens.
The citizens have always the righ to change or to modify its government, article that has been claimed by Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador as a right to summon a National Democratic Convention.
The seven judges have until August 31 to resolve all complaints and until September 6 to officially declare a president-elect or annul the elections.
Lopez Obrador has led massive protests in Mexico City over the past month demanding a full recount.
Never more will we accept that an illegal and illegitimate government is installed in our country, he told thousands of supporters following the ruling calling upon them to never accept Calderon as president and to decide if he should form a parallel government and (or) continue nationwide protests.
Leonel Castillo, the president of the tribunal, said Lopez Obrador's claims of massive fraud turned out to be completely unfounded.
Lopez Obrador's election team had filed complaints at 50,000 polling stations but the court ordered a recount at only 11,839 stations or 9% of all voting locations following massive street protests.
Calderon won the intial ballot count by a margion of less than 0.6%
Australia will press on with plans to withdraw its troops from Iraq in June this year, although promises were made by the nation's foreign minister that relations with the United States will not be affected by the move.
Foreign minister Stephen Smith said that the withdrawal will be conducted in an orderly fashion to minimise inconvenience to other nations in Iraq.
Speaking in New York as part of his first US visit since the election he said We want to do that in a way which sees minimal disruption, which causes the least inconvenience to our allies there, both the United States and the United Kingdom.
On Monday Smith will meet with Condoleezza Rice and others to discuss Afghanistan, where Australia also has troops stationed.
It is currently the intention for this to remain the case.
Smith said of the effect on relations with the US - which have been strong since World War II - It's not something which I believe will disturb what to date has been a very good working relationship between the new government and the (U.S.) administration.
It's a very strong alliance - an alliance which transcends changes in governments.
Administrations come and go, governments come and go, but the alliance is a long-term, enduring fundamental relationship between our two nations.
The confirmation is important as Australia saw a new government elected in November.
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd (Labour) defeated Conservative head and former PM John Howard.
Howard is a supporter of US President George W. Bush and his government.
Germany beat Argentina 4-2 on penalties to book a place in the Fifa World Cup semi-finals in Berlin, Friday.
The match had drawn 1-1 without many clear chances for either side due to defensive play on both sides.
First it was Germany who were unable to be positive as Argentina dominated play with 65 per cent of ball possession.
Four minutes after half-time Roberto Ayala got across Miroslav Klose to meet Juan Riquelme's corner which he powered between Jens Lehmann and his near post guard, Philipp Lahm.
The goal early in the second period made for a more exciting match which had been mostly uneventful in a first half during which neither side could muster more than a single shot.
Juergen Klinsmann may be credited with a substitution change that partially helped Germany get an equalising goal.
The fast David Odonkor troubled Juan Sorin and the Argentine left flank and allowed Germany to press forward nearer to the opposition penalty area.
Argentine manager may also have made a tactical mistake and suffered form a moment of bad fortune.
In the minutes before Germany equalised from Ballack's wonderful left field cross his goalkeeper had to be stretchered off with a muscle injury.
Jose Pekerman followed his keeper's substitutions with two defensive ones; taking off creative midfield playmaker Riquelme and forward Hernan Crespo.
The gifts of Lionel Messi and Javier Saviola were left on the bench while Julio Cruz, a long ball-holding forward, was brought on to partner Carlos Tevez.
The bad luck and changes seemed to put Germany in charge of the tactical game for the first time in the match.
A minute after Cruz arrived Pekerman might have regretted his decision.
Klose's fifth World Cup goal ten minutes from time put him at the top of the Fifa Golden Boot leader board as the tournament's highest goalscorer.
He beat his marker to dip and head beyond Leonardo Franco after Tim Borowski, a substitution on 74 minutes, had flicked on a Ballack cross.
The game finished 1-1 and the two halves of extra time mirrored the match; first half uneventful, the second half more attacking.
Fabricio Coloccini came closest to breaking the deadlock when he hit the crossbar from 45 yards trying to catch Lehmann off his goal line.
Neither Germany or Argentina had lost in a World Cup penalty contest; both sides had won three.
All the penalties hit the target and were well struck, except Ayala's who hit a soft effort which Lehmann saved to his left.
Cambiasso's effort to Lehmann's left was better struck but the keeper had guessed the right side to dive to break Argentine hearts.
FIFA launched an investigation into an on-field melee which began after the penalties had been decided in Germany's favour.
Unused Argentine substitute Leandro Cufre assaulted German Per Mertesacker and was presented the red card by Lubos Michel.
According to the German captain Michael Ballack the conflict originated when Argentine players shouted at the German team during the shootout.
When Tim Borowski got Germany's fourth penalty he made a sign to the Argentine players to be quiet.
After the penalty kicks Argentine players approached Borowski and a scuffle of mostly pushing began that involved dozens of players, referees, coaches and substitutes.
FIFA said television pictures would be looked at and fines or sanctions would be considered if appropriate.
Mark Webber gained his maiden Formula 1 win today at the German Grand Prix, after 130 races.
His Red Bull teammate Sebastian Vettel came in second, with Ferrari's Felipe Massa third.
Webber started from pole position, but touched Rubens Barrichello at the beginning after a slow start.
He received a drive through penalty for this offence, which he served at the end of his fourteenth lap.
This enabled him to join back in to the race in first place.
Jenson Button remains first in the championship with 68 points, with Vettel and Webber overtaking Barrichello, taking second and third respectively.
After the win, Webber said I lost Rubens off the start, I thought he had gone to the left but he went right and I banged into him.
I had a drive-through and my engineer kept me calm.
It was a difficult winter, Sebastian showed in winter testing what the car could do, so I kept my motivation high and I was hurting a lot.
The team had patience with me, everyone in Australia and a few people who doubted me too so hello to them as well.
Today has seen Britain's hottest recorded July day with temperatures hitting 36.5ÂºC (97.7ÂºF) in Wisley in Surrey.

Canadian researchers from C-crest Laboratories have discovered an unusually high amount of bacteria in bottled water.
Researchers don't blame specific brands, but bottled water in general.
A random study found unusually high rates of heterotrophic bacteria in the bottled water, more than 500 cfu, the legal limit set by United States Pharmacopeia on how much bacteria should be present in drinking water in Canada.
Unusually high amounts of bacteria were present in 70% of the test samples across several brands of bottled water.
â€œHeterotrophic bacteria counts in some of the bottles were found to be in revolting figures of (100) times more than the permitted limit,â€ said Sonish Azam, a Canadian researcher involved in the study, â€œThis amount of bacteria is alarming, as if we are ingesting a cup of culture.â€ 
â€œMicrobiologically speaking,â€ she said, â€œtap water is purer than bottled water â€” most bottled water.
The bacteria are not very harmful to an average person, but many sensitive groups, such as the young, sick or elderly, could get sick from it.
Heterotrophic bacteria counts in drinking water are not a health concern to the general public, was the concluding analyses of a recent study by the World Health Organization.
Vladimir Putin has relieved from power Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, the head of the Russian navy.
This comes a month after an incident where 7 Russian sailors became trapped in a submarine, and had to be rescued with help from abroad.
No reason was given for Kuroyedov's dismissal, although Admiral Eduard Baltin speculated on Moscow Radio that it may be because of the navy chief's poor health.
Admiral Kuroyedov was in charge of the navy during the Kursk disaster of 2000, in which 118 sailors died when their submarine sank.
Kuroyedov is being replaced by Vladimir Masorin, who was previously serving as the Chief of staff for the Russian Navy.
In remarks Putin made about this leadership change and referring to Masorin, he said The recent exercises, including those I have attended, show that the navy is developing and that is certainly your merit to a large extent.
Putin also added at the same time, there were difficult events, tragedies, but I would like to underline once again that with all these problems, all these tragedies, the main thing is that the Navy is undergoing a revival.
Masorin added while in a hall at the Admiralty, One thing is clear â€” to continue in the condition which we are in and do nothing is simply not possible.
I have been given the task of stopping the navy shaking public opinion.
I am not experiencing euphoria at being appointed head of the navy.
The government has announced 13 June as the date for the upcoming Mount Albert by-election.
The by-election has been caused by former Prime Minister Helen Clark's departure to head the United Nations Development Program.
While it is considered to be a safe Labour seat, the by-election is expected to be heavily contested.
So far four candidates have put their names forward Auckland city councillor Glenda Fryer, former candidate Hamish McCracken, University of Auckland political studies lecturer Meg Bates and employment lawyer Helen White.
List MP Phil Twyford, widely expected to succeed Ms Clark, has not put his name forward.
The National Party has narrowed its possible candidates down to two list MP Melissa Lee or unsuccessful 2008 candidate Ravi Musuku.
The decision will be made at a party meeting on 4 May.
The Greens and ACT New Zealand will both contest the by-election, but have yet to select candidates.
A conflict erupted between Greek Orthodox monks and Arab Christians in Jerusalem on Good Friday, as the Arab Christians protested the monks' sale of church land to Jewish residents.
Israeli police broke up the protest near the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.
Omar Harani, a 25-year-old leading the protesters, told the Telegraph, We gave the land 2,000 years ago to the Church to look after, and continued, So it is not their land to sell.
For hundreds of years we Christians, who used to be 15 per cent of the population, have been persecuted and driven out of the Holy Land and now we are a tiny minority.
But we will make our voice heard to stop this sale.
After having a meeting in Bari, Italy, on the 13th of March, the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and the Prime Minister of Italy, Romano Prodi, gave a press-conference, summarizing the results of their conversations.
The main point the two leaders agreed on was that only diplomatic means should be used in solving such international conflicts as in Afghanistan, Iraq and, especially, Iran with its nuclear program issue.
Mr. Putin confirmed once again his views on any use of armed forces in resolving such international conflicts.
Mr. Prodi agreed with the Russian President on this point and also stated that such conflicts should be solved using a multi-lateral approach, where several nations would take part in discussions.
In addition to this the potential of the UN authority should be used, added Mr. Prodi.
The Prime Minister said that Italy is looking forward to a closer cooperation with Russia in the UN Security Council, as well as in the energy sector.
All of this could be reached only through thoroughly developed partnership agreements, he added.
Held Sunday, the first annual Brampton Day at Ontario Place let hundreds of Brampton residents have fun in Toronto, while experiencing some of their own community.
Entertainment on the stage included local rock band Frayed, Cuban singing by Alexis Martinez, blues and folk from Gayle Ackroyd, Carmen Spada's smooth jazz, bhangra dancing by the Koonja and the Punjabi Virsa Art & Culture Academy, and a Brampton Theatre performance of Man of La Mancha.
Many groups and community organizations were at the event, from the Farmers' Market to the Brampton Stallions football team.
Visual Arts Brampton offered kids the chance to create artwork for their Snail Mail World Postcard Art Show, while the Brampton Arts Council gave away pink sand buckets with Region of Peel water bottles.
Young visitors were noticeably enthralled by Sassy the Squirrel, the City's mascot.
People who bought passes to the Brampton Day event through the City were encouraged to wear blue wrist bands around the park, for a chance to get spotted and win a prize.
A draw was held for prizes including green fees for four at the Peel Village Golf Course, Heritage Theatre tickets, and restaurant gift certificates.
Festival Square's proximity to Lake Ontario caused its share of trouble, particularly for the arts groups displaying in the south.
Tents were blown on their sides, becoming veritable wind sails.
Luckily no guests or volunteers were injured by the mishaps.
One painting infused with a sculpture, at the Beaux-Arts Brampton tent, was destroyed early in the day after catching a gust of wind.
Average windspeed for the Toronto Island Airport area is 12 kmh.
A woman in Australia has been killed in a shark attack.
The attack occurred at 5pm (Local Time) just off Amity Point, North Stradbroke Island, south-east of Brisbane.
The woman, described as 21, had lost both arms up to the elbow and sustained severe wounds to her torso and legs.
She was carried to shore by friends and was then flown by rescue helicopter to the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane.
The woman was holidaying from Brisbane with a church camp and attempts to contact her family have been made.
Emergency Services Rescue Helicopter crew officer Rod Morgan said the woman had suffered massive blood loss.
She was very pale he said, We were diverted right away and were able to be on the scene within minutes and were able to have the patient at hospital within an hour of the attack.
She had life threatening injuries she had lost significant amounts of blood and the patient had what we would call an altered level of consciousness where it wasn't able to communicate directly with the patient said Queensland Ambulance paramedic Lachlan Parker.
There were many witnesses at the scene and they are now being interviewed by Police at Amity Point.
One witness, who asks to not be identified, described that the victim was swimming in the sea with her Border Collie.
When the attack happened, the dog ran home to raise the alarm.
I was across the road from where she was staying and I saw the dog come flying up the road all wet and shivering and whimpering, she said, Then a little boy came running up and said the girl had lost her leg and her arm and everyone ran out of the house towards the beach.
It was just a little black-and-white dog but he was crazy so I locked him under the house.
Other reports claim that the woman had been scuba diving in murky shallow water approximately 15 metres from the shore.
The woman is believed to be from McDowall in Brisbane, but her name has not yet been released.
A resident of Amity Point for 20 years, Brad Ross, said tourists visiting the area have been warned of potential attacks; The shore just falls away into 30m of water and there are plenty of bull sharks out there.
People know when they enter the water there they're stepping into a shark habitat.
Other beaches on the island are protected by drum lines.
Queensland state police inspector Peter Harding believes from the severity of the woman's injuries that she was attacked by a group of bull sharks, a species known for aggressive behavior this time of year.
Water police will search for the sharks today and as a result, beaches on the east and west of Amity Point have been closed.
This is the first attack in the area since August 1972.
Local wisdom cautions against allowing dogs in the water at swimming beaches, because of a fear that they attract sharks, perhaps because of residue accumulated from fleas which live on the dog's blood.
Snooker player Alex Higgins, nicknamed Hurricane, was found dead in his apartment in Donegall Road, Belfast, Northern Ireland on Saturday.
He was aged 61 and had been suffering from throat cancer since 1997.
Born in Belfast on March 18, 1949, Higgins became the champion of the World Snooker Championship at the age of 23 in 1972.
Higgins' final title victory was in the Irish Professional Championship in 1989.
During 1986, he received a fine and was banned from five tournaments after headbutting a director of a tournament.
He was also banned from playing for one year in 1990 after threatening to have Dennis Taylor, another snooker player, shot.
Rock band Rage Against The Machine have beaten Joe McElderry to become the UK's official Christmas number one, following one of the biggest battles in the history of the UK Singles Chart.
Their song Killing in the Name pushed the X Factor winner's new single The Climb into second place.
A Facebook campaign backing the American band aimed to stop an X Factor winner reaching the Christmas number one spot once again.
Artists from the TV talent show, owned by music mogul Simon Cowell, have taken the festive top spot for four years in a row.
The group attracted over 900,000 members and widespread press attention, after it was started by Jon and Tracy Morter.
Are you getting fed up about the possibility of ANOTHER X-Factor Christmas No.1 ...us too...so we're going to do something about it!, they said on the group's Facebook page.
They decided to back Killing In The Name, first released in 1992.
Cowell had previously branded the campaign cynical, but on Saturday contacted the Morters to congratulate them on making a very exciting race for the Christmas number one.
The campaign has also raised over Â£69,000 for homeless charity Shelter.
Rage Against The Machine guitarist Tom Morello had backed the campaign on Twitter.
He announced that the band would play a free victory gig in the UK if they reached number one.
The result was announced on BBC Radio 1's chart show this evening by Scott Mills.
McElderry had been due to appear on the show, but did not arrive.
The latest advertisement for United States Republican presidential candidate John McCain is questioning Democrat Barack Obama's benefit to families.
Last week the BBC reported that the McCain campaign had released an advertisement comparing Obama to American celebrities Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, calling him the biggest celebrity in the world.
McCain's newest advertisement, released early this week, continues along those same lines.
Is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family the narrator asks, according to The Boston Globe and a video of the ad displayed on its website.
With images of wind turbines in the background, the narrator says, Renewable energy to transform our economy, create jobs and energy independence, that's John McCain.
The Boston Globe reports that McCain's latest ad does not acknowledge that Obama's economic policy, especially the proposed rollback of current president George W. Bush's capital gains tax cuts, would largely affect the wealthiest of America, not the middle class.
Obama, the BBC reports, is quoted as calling McCain cynical, desperate and in the pocket of Big Oil.
The latest Obama video, shown on the USA Today website, touts McCain as just more of the same politics employed by George W. Bush.
The ad cites a May 22, 2003 Fox News Channel interview where McCain says the President and I agree on most issues.
There was a recent study that showed I voted with the President over 90 percent of the time.
The ad then criticizes McCain's policies on tax cuts, money for oil companies, and tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas.
McCain is set to appear at an Ohio furniture plant Wednesday to reinforce the messages in his latest advertisement.
America has the second highest business tax rate in the entire world, he plans to say, according to prepared remarks issued by his campaign, and released by The Boston Globe.
Is it any wonder that jobs are moving overseas when we are taxing them out of the country 
Unfortunately Senator Obama's plans would raise taxes on businesses even more.â€
He has promised tax increases on income, tax increases on investment, tax increases on small businesses.
Raising taxes in a bad economy is about the worst thing you could do because it will kill even more jobs when what we need are policies that create jobs.
Is the biggest proponent of George Bushâ€™s tired, failed policies ready to bring about change 
Another day brings another dishonest attack from John McCain.
While Senator McCain knows that Senator Obama has proposed cutting taxes for 95% of American families, what heâ€™s not telling us is that he wants to give $4 billion in tax breaks to the oil companies, continue giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our job overseas, and provide no direct tax relief for more than 100 million middle-class families.
Itâ€™s time to retire these old policies and bring new energy to America.
The failure in the accumulative power supply system in Mosenergo which occurred at 1115 a.m. local time on Wednesday, led to a power outage in all areas of the city.
Some lines of the Moscow underground stopped for four hours.
Trams and trolley buses, electric trains of the Moscow railway also stopped.
In addition to lighting problems, the homeowners have also lost their water supply, as pumping stations in Mosvodokanal also lost power because of the failure.
15 big cities and five areas of Moscow suburbs, some areas of the Tula and Kaluga areas were left without electricity.
At 1200 noon, food shops in the affected areas started closing.
To avoid panic at train stations, workers with megaphones informed passengers of train movements.
According to eyewitnesses, there was no electric lighting at many stations and in transitions between them.
Thursday morning trolley buses and trams still do not work in southern areas of Moscow.
Despite repair work conducted during the night, it was impossible to power all trolleybus and tram lines.
In total 8 tram and 25 trolleybus routes do not work.
Besides this, in the south of Moscow there are still many disconnected apartment houses.
The entrance to Moscow for supersize automobiles will be limited up to 14 o'clock in the afternoon.
The limitation was put in place yesterday because of difficult road conditions in the city after the power failure.
Iraqi President Jalal Talabani in a press conference to reporters Wednesday was quoted saying He promises more details in the coming days.
The presidential news conference was in response to events unfolding by reports from Shi'ite officials.
They said Saturday that as many as 100 Shiâ€™ites were taken hostage by Sunni fighters, and were threatened with death in the town of al-Madain, near Baghdad.
An Iraqi security force on Monday raided the town of about 1,000 families, but found no evidence of a hostage situation.
The Shiâ€™ite officials later said the bodies â€” believed to be the hostages â€” were found in the Tigris River.
In a separate incident 200km north of Baghdad in Haditha, after hearing shots reporters and residents found the bodies of 19 men executed in a soccer stadium on Wednesday.
It is believed those shot were Iraqi soldiers executed by anti-government fighters, according to an Interior Ministry official, although the victims were not dressed in military garb.
They were thought to have been heading home for a holiday marking the birthday of the prophet Muhammad when abducted by insurgents.
A police officer has been killed in County Armagh, Northern Ireland by Continuity IRA gunmen a mere 48 hours after two soldiers were killed.
In what is presumed to be an attempt by dissident Republicans to derail the peace process, Pc Stephen Carroll was shot in the head just before 1000 p.m. on March 9.
The officer, described as an experienced veteran with 23 years of service, was responding to a call for help in the Lismore Manor estate in Craigavon when he was shot.
In what is described as a genuine incident, a female member of the public had called for help saying a street gang had broken a window.
A two vehicle patrol was sent to the incident given previous trouble in the area.
After standing off for a reasonable period to ensure that there was no ambush, the members of one vehicle got out to deal with the incident, whilst those in the second vehicle provided cover, while providing cover in the second vehicle that Pc Carrol was attacked.
The PSNI, believe that the officer was hit by one of two shots fired by a gunman secreted in scrubland on the estate.
There are unconfirmed reports that a second officer has also been injured.
Responsibility for the shooting has been claimed on behalf of the North Armagh Battalion of the Continuity IRA in a coded message to Belfast media.
The shooting has led to a call for unity and calm from a broad spectrum of the community ranging from spokesmen for the Ulster Volunteer Force, who called for the gunmen to be dealt with through the courts, to Sinn FÃ©in were quick to condemn the gunmen and to offer their condolences to the family of the dead officer.
This is the first death of a police officer to sectarian violence in over a decade, and comes after a nine month period in which intelligence indicated that dissidents were aiming to kill a policeman.
United State president George W. Bush kicked off the 2006 Tee Ball on South Lawn season Friday, June 23, 2006.
This is the sixth year of the White House Tee Ball Initiative.
In attendance at the game were General Peter Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who served as the Commissioner of the game, Tim Brant from ABC Sports and WJLA-TV acting as the play-by-play announcer, and seven-year old Zane Ellingwood, who founded America's Littlest Heroes last year in his hometown of Cumberland, Maryland.
In his opening remarks, Bush welcomed parents and grandparents to a historic ballpark.
Pitcher Mike O'Connor from the Washington Nationals was at the game as well.
Medha Patkar, Narmada Bachao Andolan activist in the ninth day of a hunger strike protesting the Sardar Sarovar Project, is forcibly moved to hospital in New Delhi by police.
On the ninth day of the hunger strike she and two other activists had undertaken to protest the Indian government's decision to raise the height of the Sardar Sarovar dam across the Narmada river and the lack of progress in rehabilitating people displaced by the dam project. 
Patkar was taken to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences where she was placed under intensive care.
Doctors have said that she is conscious and her condition is stable.
Police sources say that Patkar has not been arrested as of now, but an First Information Report has been lodged against her for attempting to commit suicide.
Activists of the Narmada Bachao Andolan tried to prevent the police from moving Patkar and some were arrested on rioting charges.
Over 100 Australian Jews, including two authors and a federal minister, have condemned Israel's invasion of the Gaza Strip.
The 113 signatories are members of a group known as Independent Australian Jewish Voices (IAJV).
Antony Loewenstein, the groups founder, told The Age that he expected outrage from the loudest Jewish voices.
But the IAJV had found a sizeable minority of Australian Jews who valued an independent perspective as opposed to the blindly pro-Israel position.
However, since Palestinians have no means of self-defence against the most powerful military force in the Middle East.
We particularly call on Israel to end its brutal assault on the vulnerable Palestinian people of Gaza and to reconsider its rejection of the United Nations Security Council's call for a ceasefire, the statement said.
History has demonstrated that military punishment has never broken the spirit of a people or produced peace, added the statement.
It would only inflame hatred of Jews and of Israel, while doing nothing to protect the lives of Israelis.
Above all, it would undermine attempts to work with peace-seeking Palestinians for a lasting, just solution.
Colin Rubenstein, executive director of the AustraliaIsrael and Jewish Affairs Council, said the statement was up to Mr Loewenstein's usual form â€” totally wrong on every fact, totally unbalanced, and totally insensitive to Israeli suffering.
They propose that the population of southern Israel must continue to live under constant rocket bombardment, opposing all practical efforts to actually invoke the right to self-defence the signatories say they recognize, he said.
Some flu viruses in the United States and Canada have shown increased levels of resistance to the antiviral drug Tamiflu (oseltamivir), the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday.
Tamiflu is currently the recommended treatment for humans infected with bird flu, and governments worldwide have been stockpiling the drug in case of a flu pandemic.
The drug resistance appears to be limited to the H1N1 variant which causes seasonal flu, while H3N2 or influenza B strains and the H5N1 strain that causes bird flu did not show increased resistance.
While previous studies showed resistance levels below 1%, samples tested by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now showed around 5% resistance, and in a Canadian survey of 81 samples, 8 showed resistance.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control found 19 cases of resistance among 148 samples from last November.
In a wider study of 437 H1N1 isolates from 19 countries, the European agency found 59 resistant samples from 9 countries.
Resistance has not been shown to increase in Japan or Hong Kong.
The WHO is now contacting national authorities to get more data on flu resistance.
These viruses have acquired a mutation that makes them resistant, and the WHO statement said that a resistant strain has probably emerged spontaneously.
The statement added that these mutations would most likely render Tamiflu ineffective for the prevention or treatment of flu caused by resistant H1N1 viruses.
The WHO also stated that this phenomenon does not influence the effectiveness of flu immunizations.
Resistant strains have shown no evidence of causing more severe disease or being more easily transmissible.
The Labour Party's 2005 election manifesto read We are committed to retaining the independent nuclear deterrentâ€.
Although there have been reports that planning and design work on replacement vessels and new designs of nuclear war heads has been proceeding for some years, the first Cabinet meeting to consider this pledge will take place tomorrow.
No Cabinet papers have been circulated before the meeting at which it is said there will be a â€œfirst run round the issuesâ€.
A further Cabinet meeting is to be held prior to the publication of a White Paper just before Christmas.
The principle of retaining a nuclear deterrent will be put to the vote in the House of Commons next year and, although it may split the Labour Party, is likely to be carried with the support of the Conservative opposition.
It is reported that some Cabinet Ministers have reservations about the prudence of maintaining the nuclear deterrent when the apparent threats are from saboteurs and suicide bombers.
They also have doubts about the legality of adding to the stock of nuclear warheads contrary to the spirit of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and about the way that the decision is being pushed through without consultation with the Labour Party.
Among those with doubts are the Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett, Hilary Benn, Minister of State for International Development, and Peter Hain, Secretary of State for Wales and Northern Ireland.
The only other European country with nuclear capability is France.
Prime Minister Blair and Chancellor Brown are agreed on the need to retain a nuclear deterrent.
Their reasons include keeping the country's seat at the top table of international politics.
The Trident missile system is carried in four nuclear-powered Vanguard class submarines, the first of which was commissioned in August 1993.
The current Trident system cost Â£12.6 Bn to introduce at 1996 prices, and requires Â£280m a year to maintain.
Replacements for the smaller nuclear-powered wattack submarines are under construction and will be armed with Tomahawk missile tactical missile systems.
The atomic weapons establishment at Aldermaston is reported to be developing tactical nuclear weapons, smaller and of shorter range than Trident suitable for firing using the same type of launcher as Tomahawks.
The United States House of Representatives has passed the bipartisan US$152 billion economic stimulus package that gives one-time rebates to United States citizens, US$600 for individuals or US$1,200 for couples plus US$300 for each child.
US$300 checks would be sent to people on low-income including retirees on Social Security which was not included in the original bill backed by President George W. Bush.
The plan would begin to decrease rebates for citizens with taxable incomes of US$75,000 for individuals and US$150,000 for couples.
The checks would go out to more than a 130 million Americans according to Treasury secretary Henry Paulson.
The House overwhelmingly approved the more broad Senate amended bill which included the low-income portion mentioned above along with provisions that would keep illegal aliens from receiving a rebate check.
Despite some opposition from some Congressmen, such as John B. T. Campbell III of California's 48th congressional district, the plan passed overwhelmingly 380â€“34.
Campbell called the plan wealth redistribution and noted it did not have safeguards to prevent illegals from receiving these rebates and also claimed that stimulus plan would increase the deficit more and noted the cause of the looming recession was because of credit problems.
The United States Senate voted hours earlier on the bill which passed in the Senate, 81â€“16. after having to shed some incentives included by Senate Democrats which caused the bill to fail.
Some of the incentives that were left out of the plan in a compromise to gain Republican support were demands for benefits for long-term unemployed workers and stipulation that would allow low-income citizens to pay off heating bills and let home builders pay off losses off the current year against previous tax years.
President Bush approved of the package, noting in a statement, This plan is robust, broad-based, timely, and it will be effective, this bill will help to stimulate consumer spending and accelerate needed business investment.
His convictions include assaulting his fourth wife in 2006, and he served four months despite requesting community service; a stab attack from behind with a five-inch blade on a friend landed him a two-year suspended sentence and put the man in hospital.
He also served thirteen months for stabbing a friend while drinking and has been prosecuted for attacking a man with a knife in a restaurant, a case dropped through lack of evidence.
According to a spokesman for NATO, an attempted hijacking of a Norwegian tanker in the Gulf of Aden by Somali pirates has been thwarted by NATO forces.
The MV Front Ardennes came under attack by pirates in a small skiff at about 600 PM on Saturday.
Helicopters and a warship were dispatched to rescue the vessel, and the pirates were apprehended seven hours after the initial hijacking.
Officials said that pirates tried to flee in the dark, but were caught by a Canadian vessel.
Seven of the pirate gunmen were temporarily detained, but were later released.
NATO spokesman Lieutenant Commander Alexandre Santos Fernandes stated that since there was no Canadian law that could have prosecuted the pirates, they had to be released.
Piracy is rife off the eastern coast of Africa; on Saturday, Somali pirates seized a Belgian ship, the Pompei, with its ten crew members, as it was headed south for the Seychelles islands.
Over sixty ships, in total have been hijacked by pirates since the start of last year.
Currently, pirates are thought to be holding about three hundred crew members from seventeen ships.
An on duty superintendent in the New South Wales Police Force was caught speeding in an unmarked police car at 176kmh in a 100kmh zone on the Olympic Highway near Junee, New South Wales on October 13.
Superintendent Frank Goodyer, who was caught by his own officers in the Wagga Wagga Local Area Command, was charged with driving at more than 45kmh over the speed limit, had his automatically license suspended for six months and fined A$1674.
It was reported by Sydney radio station 2GB that it was Superintendent Frank Goodyer as the officer who was caught speeding by his own officers after the New South Wales Police released a media release which did not name the officer who was caught.
Superintendent Frank Goodyer told ABC Radio, I accepted the penalty.
I accept that I've done the wrong thing and, as I say, it is still my job as a senior police officer to encourage safe driving and I will continue to do that regardless of my actions.
The European Commission (EC) has approved yesterday a takeover of loss-making UK airline bmi from Lufthansa by International Airlines Group (IAG), owner of British Airways (BA). 
IAG will have to make concessions after told the EC the deal would be anti-competitive.
The deal is set to cost IAG, who also ownÂ Iberia,Â£172.5 million.
That value could fall as budget subsidiary may be retained by Lufthansa or sold elsewhere, and IAG are reported to be primarily interested in the main bmi business.
IAG intends to use acquired slots at the busy , which serves London, to expand their own routes into Asia.
The EC required IAG to surrender a number of flight slots at the airport.
The slots surrendered or made available for lease are for use to destinations in Scotland, France, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Russia.
The EC also insisted that combined BAbmi routing be made available for competitors to buy transfer seats upon.
Lufthansa intended to shut down bmi had the bid failed.
IAG boss called the sale great news for Britain with results that are good for UK business and UK consumers.
Virgin boss had previously said the move would give BA excessive dominance on Scottish flights.
More Heathrow slots earmarked for Scotland have been given up than any other destination.
Ryanair took the opportunity to claim only their own takeover bid for Aer Lingus has been a major EC casualty.
Today's rubber-stamping of BA's purchase of bmi shows yet again that the EC has one rule for Europe's flag-carriers, but different rules for Ryanair, said Ryanair chief .
Nine people have died in bush-fires in the region of the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia.
The fire has spread over 40,000 hectares of scrub, bushland and farmland so far and is still burning out of control.
Hundreds of firemen have been fighting the fire, but conditions have been difficult because of strong winds and temperatures soaring well over 40 degrees Celsius.
Of the nine who have died, eight were attempting to escape the advancing fire in their cars.
Locals of some rural towns fled to the ocean to escape the fires.
Thousands of sheep and cattle have also been killed in the fires.
Separate fires have also been burning around Mount Osmond and Cleland National Park in the Adelaide hills.
Bush-fires are annual occurrences in Australia, but these fires have been the worst in terms of deaths since the Ash Wednesday fires that killed 28 people in South Australia.
Two years ago, over 400 houses were burnt down in a bush fire in the Australian capital city, Canberra.
Today, Nintendo revealed that the real name for the console previously known by the codename Revolution, is Wii.
The name was revealed in a message posted on Nintendo of America's official site, which is shown below.
In the immediate aftermath of the announcement, the name received much criticism for sounding too much like wee, an English slang word meaning urine.
The name also sounds similar to yes in French and good in Japanese.
Australian Prime Minister John Howard has attacked US presidential candidate Barack Obama on his pledge to introduce a bill that would withdraw American troops from Iraq by March 2008.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Howard said the move would hand victory to insurgents in Iraq.
I think that would just encourage those who wanted completely to destabilise and destroy Iraq, and create chaos and victory for the terrorists to hang on and hope for (an) Obama victory, Mr Howard said.
If I was running al-Qaeda in Iraq, I would put a circle around March 2008, and pray, as many times as possible, for a victory not only for Obama, but also for the Democrats.
Mr Obama dismissed Howard's comments as empty rhetoric, unless he was to send another 20,000 Australians to fight in Iraq.
So, if he's (inaudible) if to fight the good fight in Iraq, I would suggest that he calls up another 20,000 Australians and sends them to Iraq.
I would also note that we have close to 140,000 troops on the ground now, and my understanding is that Mr Howard has deployed 1,400, said Mr Obama.
The Australian government said its contribution to the war in Iraq was appropriate given Australia's population and military size and that Obama's response failed to address the substance of the issue.
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said 20,000 troops would be half of our army.
Mr Howard, considered a close ally of the United States government, has faced attacks and support from US politicians.
Democrat Terry McAuliffe said Firstly, the Prime Minister has been a great friend of George Bush's.
He has been with him lock-step from day one on this war in Iraq.
Republican presidential candidate Duncan Hunter said Howard had earned a right to comment about Obama's policy I think the Aussies have earned a right to comment on the world stage about their partner in this endeavour, because they've been fighting side-by-side with us in Iraq, said Hunter.
And so I think that John Howard, while it wasn't a very complimentary statement, he is basically stating the truth and that is that what we say on the Senate floor on or the House floor goes to a world audience.
And it has an impact on not only our allies, but also our adversaries.
Roy Ryden, another US Democrat said Mr Howard's comment was bizarre and accused the Prime minister of interfering with US politics The most charitable thing you can say about Mr Howard's comment is bizarre.
You know, we'll make our own judgements in this country with respect to elections and Barack Obama is a terrific public servant.
Mr Howard has drawn criticism from some conservative Republicans with John Cornyn saying Howard should stay out of US domestic politics.
The Australian Prime Minster further defended his statement today, claiming Obama's plan threatened Australia's national security.
If the United States were to withdraw her combat units from Iraq by the early part of next year it could only be represented as a defeat for the United States in Iraq, he said.
I hold the strongest possible view that it is contrary to the security interests of this country for America to be defeated in Iraq.
Australia's strong links to the United States and its support for the U.S.-led war on Iraq were key issues for Howard's fourth straight election win in late 2004.
The Australian opposition has used the comments as an opportunity to attack the government.
Opposition leader Kevin Rudd said Howard needed to avoid taking sides in American politics as it was important for the Australia-U.S. alliance that leaders could deal with each other despite their political affiliations.
An estimated over 100,000 people protested in Tahrir Square yesterday in opposition to a constitutional decree made by Egypt's President Mohamed Morsi.
Riot police dispersed the crowd with tear gas as clashes began.
The constitutional decree made November 22 by Morsi protected the constitution drafting body of Egypt from dissolution and also protected executive decisions from being overturned.
The decree has sparked protests and strikes reminiscent of protests which eventually toppled the then president Hosni Mubarak.
Earlier this year in September Egyptian courts ruled to dissolve Egypt's parliament.
Morsi opposed the ruling, threatening action, but later respected the decision.
Mohamed ElBaradei said Morsi is acting like a new .
ElBaradei has also said that because of the recent decree a civil war threatens to erupt in Egypt.
Counter demonstration planned by the Muslim Brotherhood and Nour Party has been cancelled to avoid possible further violence.
Honey-bee decline has accelerated in North America beyond the steady attrition of the past 25 years according to scientists and farmers.
A relatively new term - Colony Collapse Disorder is being used to describe this poorly understood phenomenon.
Colony Collapse Disorder (or CCD) is a syndrome evidenced by massive die-off affecting an entire insect population.
The cause of the syndrome is not yet well understood.
CCD may be caused by mites or associated diseases or unknown pathogens.
CCD is possibly linked to pesticide use though several studies have found no common environmental factors between unrelated outbreaks studied.
According to Dennis vanEngelsdorp, a bee specialist with the Pennsylvania State Department of Agriculture, We are pretty sure, but not certain, that it is a contagious disease.
Honey-bees are responsible for approximately one third of the United States crop pollination including such species as peaches, soybeans, apples, pears, pumpkins, cucumbers, cherries, raspberries, blackberries and strawberries.
From 1971 to 2006, approximately one half of the U.S. honey-bee colonies vanished.
The rate of attrition reached new proportions in the year 2006, which were alarming to many farmers and honey-bee scientists.
At least eleven different states as well as portions of Canada are known to have been affected by colony collapse disorder.
The disorder has been identified in a geographically diverse group of states including Georgia, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and California.
In some states the loss of honey-bee colonies is estimated as high as 75 percent of the population.
The phenomenon is particularly important for crops such as almond growing in California, where honey-bees are the predominant pollinator and the crop value is $US 1.5 billion.
Total U.S. crops that are wholly dependent on the honey-bee are known to exceed $US 15 billion.
In a related development on January 17, 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has drastically tightened use rules on some of the chief pesticides used on apples, blueberries, grapes, peaches, pears and other fruits pollenized by honey-bees.
Citing general environmental protection and farmworker safety, the EPA recently announced the tightening of use or phaseout of the highly toxic pesticides phosmet and Azinphos methyl.
Under these rule changes the use of these organophosphate pesticide would be allowed continued use for five years but have somewhat reduced dosage limits.
Azinphos methyl is a dangerous neurotoxin derived from nerve agents used during World War II.
South Korea has lost contact with its Naro-1 rocket, just 137 seconds after take-off.
Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) and Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center had hoped to use a Naro-1, South Korea's first carrier rocket, to launch a STSAT-2B satellite.
South Korea had postponed the launch on Wednesday due to problems with the rocket's fire extinguisher system.
Science Ministry spokesman Pyun Kyung-bum said, We expect that it will be difficult to launch today.
The rocket lifted off from Goheung's Naro Space Centre at 1701 (0801 GMT) today.
The rocket apparently exploded 137 seconds after launch, when a flash was seen from an on-board camera and communication was lost.
The loss of communication occurred when the rocket had achieved an altitude of around 70 kilometers (43 mi).
Television cameras captured a white speck, presumably part of the rocket, falling into the sea.
Analysts say the failure is a setback for South Korea.
If it had been successful, it would have been the first Naro-1 launch to reach orbit.
The launch cost South Korea an estimated US$400 million, and if successful, would have launched a satellite called the STSAT-2B into orbit.
The satellite was designed to examine climate change and its effects.
The incident is seen as a major setback for South Korea's space program, which had been aiming to become the 10th country to achieve the capability to launch satellites, and the fourth Asian country, after China, Japan, and India.
A successful launch would have helped South Korea to become a player in commercial space launches, an industry valued at around US$250 billion.
Since 1992, South Korea has launched 11 satellites from overseas sites with foreign-made rockets.
A strong earthquake struck off the southern tip of Taiwan at 1226 UTC, triggering a warning from Japan's Meteorological Agency that a 3.3 foot tsunami could be heading towards Basco, in the Philippines.
The head of the earthquake monitoring agency in the Philippines disputed the Japanese agency's warnings, however.
Conflicting reports have placed the magnitude of the quake between 6.7 and 7.2 on the Richter Scale, with the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau marking it at 6.7, the United States Geological Survey estimating it at 7.1, and the Japan Meteorological Agency putting the magnitude at 7.2.
Despite the Japanese Meteorological Agency's warning of a tsunami threat to the Philippines, Renato Solidum, the director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, denied that a tsunami is headed towards the Philippines, saying that the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii had not released any tsunami advisory.
Nevertheless, Solidum said that residents in low-lying areas in the Philippines should, as a precaution, move to higher ground.
In the aftermath of the quake, news agencies have aired reports of collapsed houses, hotel guests being trapped in elevators, and telephone outages due to severed lines across Taiwan.
The earthquake has damaged six submarine fiber-optic communications cables, restricting internet access to millions of users in Asia and Australia.
Home users are experiencing severe connection issues, with timeouts becoming very common.
The Internet Storm Center is reporting a 100% packet loss on certain routers.
A sample ping test from Singapore to Wikinews came up with a 380 millisecond average round trip at 50% packet loss.
The financial markets are facing an even more alarming situation, with financial news and stock quotes from the U.S. and Europe not being able to reach Asian markets.
Repairing the lines is not a matter of days, says Hong Seoung-Yong, a ministry official from South Korea handling the problem.
Taiwan's internet capacity has dropped to 40%, and consequently the networks there are jammed.
Service providers may choose to bypass those lines in favour of European ones, say a spokesman for Japanese telecoms firm KDDI Corp, Satoru Ito.
The quake took place exactly two years from the day that the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake struck, devastating Southeast Asia.
That 2004 earthquake registered as a magnitude 9.1, and caused a tsunami with waves reaching as high as 33 feet.
Peruvians living near the site of a release of mercury are preparing to sue a U.S. mining company, announcing last Saturday that they will bring their case before a Denver judge.
On June 2, 2000, a serious accident in the province of Cajamarca, in Peru, poisoned many residents with mercury, a highly toxic heavy metal.
A truck from Newmont Mining Company dumped two metal canisters of mercury along an Andean highway, in the communities of San Juan, Choropampa, and Magdalena.
Curious townspeople (mostly children) picked up the silvery droplets, and some even drank some of it.
Some of those who came in contact with the mercury suffered blindness, and one even had a purplish rash on her body.
Over 300 people directly suffered the effects of mercury poisoning.
As the owners of the Yanacocha mine which produced the mercury, Newmont Mining offered up to US$6 thousand to more than 700 local residents, but over 1,100 others are still engaged in a legal battle with Newmont over the case.
In today's global economy, many international businesses have looked overseas to maintain their profits, but environmental law professor James Otto is asking about the cost to the environment and public health.
Any company that wants to mine internationally now must not only have the legal right to mine but also a 'social license' to operate, he said.
As the Peruvian residents gear up for their lawsuit against Denver-based Newmont Mining, the world's largest gold mining firm, some of these important questions may finally be answered.
After the breakdown of mediation talks with Newmont on January 20, the residents and their lawyer decided to stop negotiating behind closed doors and take their case to the public.
Last Saturday, March 5, 2005, they announced that they are bringing their suit before Denver District Judge Robert Hyatt.
This is not the first time Newmont Mining has had trouble with an emerging Third World environmental movement.
Recently, in August 2004, a US$543 million lawsuit was filed against Newmont Mining by the Indonesian Environmental Ministry and local villagers.
They claim that pollution caused by the companyâ€™s mining activities has caused serious illnesses and other health problems, including skin disease, tumors, birth defects, and a decline in fish stocks, a staple food.
One particular mining practice used frequently by Newmont Mining in Indonesia is submarine tailings disposal, a waste disposal method for mercury and arsenic that is outlawed in the United States.
At least six Newmont Mining managers, including an American and an Australian, face up to 15 years in a Jakarta prison for environmental and corporate crime in that case.
The local Peruvian residents are continuing their fight for safer mining practices and compensation for existing damage and injuries.
Thousands of local townspeople protested against the Yanacocha mine last fall, demanding protection for the local water supply.
Newmont Mining officials have blamed the June 2000 mercury spill on a contractor, and have lost the battle to keep the case out of the American court system.
The Somalian government called on Saturday for the international community to help stem the wave of recent seafaring pirate attacks off their coast in the Indian Ocean.
The London-based International Maritime Bureau (IMB) reported yesterday that a Thai merchant vessel and its crew of 26 have been hijacked by Somalian pirates off their coastline.
The predominantly Thai crew were kidnapped at gunpoint, and a ransom has been demanded for their release.
The merchant ship was en-route from Brazil to Yemen with a cargo of sugar.
A letter to Somalia from the United Nations security council admonished the government.
Somalia has largely disintegrated into fiefdoms since the former dictator Siad Barre was ousted in 1991.
Last weekend, a U.S.-owned cruise ship was attacked with rocket propelled grenades.
It is the fourth ship to be attacked in the space of a week.
According to the IMB, there have been 23 other pirating attacks in coastal waters off the east African nation since March 15.
The Obama Administration has denied Colombian journalist Hollman Morris entry into the United States, citing violation of the terrorist activities section of the USA's Patriot Act.
Morris was attempting to obtain a visa to attend Harvard University's Nieman Program, which is a fellowship for journalists.
The journalist has called attention to ties between outgoing Colombian president Alvaro Uribe, and right-wing militia groups in the war-plagued South American country.
Human rights activists have speculated that Uribe might have influenced the visa denial.
Morris' phone has also been tapped by the DAS, the Colombian state security agency, which is Colombia's CIA counterpart.
Though the exact reason for Morris' visa denial is unclear, when Morris went on-site to cover the release of four Colombian security force members' release by FARC rebels, Uribe called the journalist an accomplice of terrorism.
At least 11 new species of life have been discovered in the rainforests of Thua Thien-Hue Province in Vietnam in a region of the forest described as the Green Corridor.
The discovery was made by researchers from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).
Among the new species are five orchids and at least three other species of plants, two butterflies and a snake.
At least ten more species of plants are believed to be new species but are still being studied.
You only discover so many new species in very special places, and the Green Corridor is one of them.
Several large mammal species were discovered in the 1990s in the same forests, which means that these latest discoveries could be just the tip of the iceberg, said a technical adviser in Vietnam for the WWF, Chris Dickinson.
The new species of life are exclusive to the rainforest in Thua Thien-Hue Province.
The new snake, which can grow to 80 centimeters long, has been given the name white-lipped keelback because of a yellow-white stripe on the top of its head and makes its home near small streams and feeds on small animals and frogs.
The new species of butterflies are one subfamily of the Satyrinae species and the other a species of the Skipper butterfly.
The orchids, all of which are considered very rare because they were found to have no leaves whatsoever on the plant, grow in matter that is rotting and also contain no chlorophyll.
The other two new plant species are of Arum and Aspidistra.
The WWF is concerned that civilization may move closer into the rainforest, destroying the homes of these new species, but the government of Thua Thien-Hue Province says it's dedicated to making sure that they are protected, along with the rainforest.
The area is extremely important for conservation and the province wants to protect the forests and their environmental services, as well as contribute to sustainable development, said Provincial Forest Protection Department Director for the province, Hoang Ngoc Khanh.
The species were found in the rainforest in 2005 and 2006.
Hurricane Paloma, which the U.S. National Hurricane Center yesterday labeled as extremely dangerous, has recently hit Cuba.
In preparation of this, at 1500 UTC yesterday, the Cuban provinces of Granma and Holguin were issued with a Hurricane warning by the country's government.
Due to updated forecasts, it has also removed the waning for the province of Sancti Spiritus.
220,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas in the Camaguey province, while 170,000 were evacuated from the province of Las Tunas.
The Hurricane is now weakening, however, with the NOAA stating that continued weakening is expected over the next day or two, even after Paloma moves off the coast of Cuba.
The NOAA has also stated that Paloma is expected to produce additional rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches over eastern Cuba.
Rainfall accumulations of 5 to 10 inches are possible over the central Bahamas.
Hurricane Paloma was the seventeenth tropical depression of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season.
Paloma developed out of a strong tropical disturbance off the northern coast of Honduras on November 5.
The depression then became a tropical storm then a hurricane.
The men's team final in artistic gymnastics reached a tense conclusion last night at the Olympic Games in London.
Japan took silver with 271.952 points, and Great Britain got bronze with 271.711 points.
Britain initially looked likely to win silver following a fall from the pommel horse by Japanese gymnast KÅhei Uchimura.
Uchimura unexpectedly fell from the horse but managed to recover and land on his feet.
Before the appeal, Uchimura's score left Japan in fourth place with Britain taking silver and Ukraine taking bronze with 271.526 points.
The judges accepted Uchimura's appeal and increased Japan's final score by 0.7 points, just edging out Great Britain by 0.241 points.
British gymnast Louis Smith celebrated Britain's bronze It's a beautiful day for the sport and for British gymnastics.
Smith also promised great things from Britain's up-and-coming male gymnasts, promising that team members Sam Oldham and Max Whitlock would improve for the next Olympics in Rio. 
Smith also commended the junior squad The juniors we've got coming up â€” we've been junior European champions for the last six years â€” there's so much depth.
The US team, who had come first in the qualifying round, came fifth in the finals which led to tears from John Orozco.
The US team vowed to fight on in the individual competition.
Steve Penny from USA Gymnastics told reporters Our guys know that they're better than fifth place, and they're going to try to show that off through the rest of the competition.
At least 30 people have been killed by twin earthquakes in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Deputy Rwandan Police Chief Mary Gahonzire spoke to Reuters in Kigali, saying of a magnitude 5.0 to 6.0 quake that struck there The death toll [in Rwanda] has now increased to 25 from the earthquake.
Two hundred have serious injuries, while Bernard Watunakanza, acting governor of South Kivu's Bukavu region, said Up to now, there are five dead and 149 seriously injured.
This makes the total current death toll 30 and injury count 350.
Radio Rwanda reports that ten of the Rwandan fatalities occurred together when a church collapsed onto them, killing them instantly.
AFP reports the Rwandan ambulance service cannot cope with the casualties and public buses have been drafted in to help.
The quake could also be felt in nearby Burundi, but there are no reports of damage or injuries there.
A Kamov-32 fire-fighting helicopter has crashed while trying to fill its water tanks, reports the Turkish Anatolian News agency.
Since mid-August, the forest fires have swept the Southern part of Turkey including popular tourist destinations like Bodrum and Antalya-Kas.
Lately the General Directorate for Forestry has sent short text messages through Turkish operators for citizens to be aware of forest fires.
Amid warnings another fire started in Kas during the weekend.
The latest fire in Kas was taken under control with the help from fire helicopters, where the Kamof-32 type Russian fire helicopter has crashed while filling its tanks with water from nearby Lake Gombe.
Three Russian citizens working with the team, a Turkish pilot and a Turkish engineer have reported to be fine and in good condition in Gombe Health Center.
Iran's Minister of Justice Gholam-Hossein Elham has requested that Dutch politician Geert Wilders' Qur'an film named Fitna should be prohibited by the Dutch government, Iranian press-agency IRNA reports.
Elham wrote a letter to his Dutch colleague Ernst Hirsch Ballin stating that you can stop the process of this satanic and conspiracy movement based on the European Convention on Human Rights.
Freedom of speech cannot be the reason to allow this film, they say.
We also respect freedom of speech, but the insult of holy and ethical values is totally unacceptable, Elham writes.
The rights of Muslims all over the world are violated by this blaspheming movie.
The Qur'an is the holy book for some 1.5 billion Muslims worldwide.
Wilders announced his shocking movie to be ready in March 2008.
The city hall building in Buffalo, New York was evacuated after fire alarms were activated.
Smoke detectors went off on the 13th and 27th floors.
Among other things we lost all communications out of the building.
Something cut off communications, something set off those alarms and cut power to elevators, said Mike Lombardo, Buffalo's fire commissioner.
Police and fire crews arrived on scene to discover a power surge in the 27th floor knocked out all communications between the police and fire departments in the city for nearly two hours.
Fire crews had to use emergency stairways to examine the building for fire and evacuees of the 32-story building had to use emergency stairways to evacuate because elevators in the building were not functioning properly.
According to Lombardo, it looks like we have no fire whatsoever [in the building] and that all 2,800 workers were allowed to return to work shortly after 1200 p.m.
We've been able to re-set things...we feel very confident that there's no other problems, added Lombardo.
Thousands of people have taken to the streets of Krakow objecting to plans to bury the Polish president, Lech Kaczynski, at Wawel Castle.
Kaczynski and his wife are set to be buried on Sunday.
Burial spaces at Wawel castle are normally reserved for Polish kings and heroes.
Polish film director Andrzej Wajda voiced his opinion on the plans of the late presidentâ€™s burial site, saying that Lech Kaczynski was an ordinary and good man, but there is no reason for him to lie in the Wawel among the kings of Poland and Marshal JÃ³zef PiÅ‚sudski [the founder of modern-day Poland].
He continued to comment, saying that the decision had been â€œmisplacedâ€.
Several of the worldâ€™s leaders and dignitaries are to attend the president's funeral, including US president Barack Obama and Russian leader Dmitry Medvedev.
Local British councillors have reported that they have seized ice cream made from the breast milk of human beings that had been placed on sale in a shop located in London, England, United Kingdom.
A Westminster City Council spokeswoman explained that two complaints made by members of the public were being replied to by the council.
The Icecreamists, the marketing company involved with the dessert known as 'Baby Gaga', are fully co-operating with officials who are carrying out tests that are currently ongoing.
The breast milk was donated by fifteen women who responded to an online advertisement located on a forum aimed at mothers.
According to the company, all milk is screened for the highest and safest standards before it is pasteurized and prepared for human consumption.
It is then mixed with the zest of lemons and vanilla seed cases.
Matt O'Connor, who founded the Icecreamists, stated As far as we are aware there is no law prohibiting a business from selling breast milk ice cream.
He claimed that [i]f it's good enough for our children, it's good enough for the rest of us and [s]ome people will hear about it and go yuck - but actually it's pure organic, free-range and totally natural.
Brian Connell, a member of the the Conservative Party in the UK, believes that [a]s the local authority we will support small businesses and applaud innovative ideas wherever possible, but must protect the health of consumers.
On Monday in Canberra, the Australian government released its annual budget, one that promises a A$1.5 billion surplus for the year, but little was said of the potential impact of the budget on Australian sport in an Olympic year when Australia is looking to earn the fewest medals since the 1996 Games in Atlanta.
There were no apparent surprises for the sports sector in Australia in this budget.
The budget, available online, claims A$380 million has been spent preparing for the 2012 Olympic Games.
According to Keith Lyons, the University of Canberra Director of the National Institute of Sport Studies, sport is an important part of Australian culture and the development of sport enjoys bipartisan support.
The sport budget supports infrastructure developments and reflects a renewal of Australian sport venues post .
The Active After School investment reflects a commitment to support participation and engagement in physical activity and sport.
When Tony Naar of the Australian Paralympic Committee was asked about the impact of the budget on his organisation's efforts, he said there was little to report as there were very few previously unannounced initiatives... the overall level of program funding was in line with the final year of the current funding cycle.
The budget promises to support cricket, specifically the 2015 Cricket World Cup, and soccer (football) with the 2015 Asian Cup by allocating funding for facility improvement.
A$50 million will be spent on redeveloping the Sydney Cricket Ground, A$30 million on redeveloping the Adelaide Oval, and A$15 million on redeveloping the Bellerive Oval in Hobart.
A partnership between the government, New South Wales Government and the Sydney Cricket and Sports Ground Trust will cover additional costs associated with the Sydney Cricket Ground with work completed by 2014.
Local sporting infrastructure will be supported in the budget with A$30 million earmarked for this, A$10 million specifically to improve Melbourne's Olympic Park Precinct, A$5 million to support football in western Sydney, and A$3 million for Football New South Wales to build a new headquarters.
The budget promises assistance to parents to defray the cost of their children's extracurricular activities including sport as part of the SchoolKid Bonus, which will replace the Education Tax Refund.
Support for school based youth sport with A$39.2 million allocated to Active After-School Communities, a program that reaches 190,000 children, which encourages them to participate in school sports.
In an attempt to curb drowning deaths of young children, an initiative has been launched to improve water safety that will be run through early childhood centres.
A$19.2 million was extended to the Australian Sport Commission to run its Active After-School Communities program in 20122013 with similar funding for 20132014.
2,000 schools and 1,300 afterout of school programs will benefit from the funding.
Community Street Soccer was allocated A$1.0 million for 20122013 and A$1.6 million for 20132014.
Aimed at bringing the homeless and unemployed into the community through participation in soccer, Reclink Australia will be given the funding to implement the program.
A$4.8 million was allocated to the Clontarf Foundation in New South Wales to support local sport and utilised elsewhere encourage Indigenous girls to participate in sport in Western Australia, Northern Territory, Victoria and Queensland through the Sporting Chance Program.
Canberra's Centenary celebrations are addressed in the Federal budget, with A$2.6 million allocated for 20112012, A$2.0 million allocated for 20122013 and A$1.0 million allocated for 20132014.
Some money will go towards sport as a part of these celebrations.
The Federal government is investing in Glenorchy, Tasmania, budgeting A$8.7 million in the redevelopment of the King George V sports and community precinct, with the money given to the local government.
Not all of the money is earmarked for sport, with some money paying for a dedicated office for the Migrant Resource Centre.
A$1,870,000 less was budgeted for the from what was actually spent in 20112012's budget.
The government expects A$5.8 million in savings in the next four years because of changes in athlete doping testing.
In the 20112012 budget year, A$2,729,510 was spent on Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport in special appropriations.
All money in the category is allocated in line with the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995.
In the Sport and Recreation Special Account out of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet appropriation budget, the cash flow and balance opened the budget year with A$920,000 and receipts totaled A$317,000.
In the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport appropriation budget, the Sport and Recreation Special Account had has an opening balance of A$949,000.
Estimates for receipts for 20122013 are A$537,000, up from A$220,000 in actual receipts in 20112012's budget.
The Australian Sports Commission spent A$214,534,000 in 20112012 in their first budget category, and have a smaller budget of A$101,942,000 for 20122013 in the same category.
In their budget second category, they spent A$54,159,000 in 20112012, with the 20122013 budget increasing the budget to A$166,201,000.
For total appropriations, the first area decreased by a total of A$117,170,000 and the second area saw an increase in of A$114,353,000.
Large herd animals may have the ability to detect earth's magnetic field, concluded scientists in Germany in a report published in this week's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences after performing studies of cattle and deer grazing and sleeping patterns.
The animals tended to face north-south oriented toward the earth's magnetic poles.
Hynek Burda of the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany led the team that announced the unconfirmed study.
Burda and his team gathered cattle data via analysis of Google Earth images.
The team originally intended to test for possible human magnetic field detection by studying the orientation of sleeping bags in outdoor campers, but it proved difficult to obtain data because humans usually slept under tents.
Cattle were easier to observe, and 8,510 head of cattle at 308 locations demonstrated a strong tendency to align body orientation in accordance with the earth's magnetic field.
Other possible factors such as wind or sunlight direction did not supply a better explanation for the behavior.
To compare against a second large species, Burda and his team analyzed data on 2,974 deer studied through photography, direct observation, and snow imprints.
I think the really amazing thing is that hunters and herdsmen and farmers didn't notice it, said Burda according to a National Public Radio report.
Peter August of the University of Rhode Island in Kingston, commented I was really amazed at the consistency with which they found north-facing cows and deer.
No independent study has yet confirmed the Duisburg-Essen team's findings.
This is the first study that indicates magnetic field detection in large mammals.
Burda's previous research involves naked mole rats, a small blind mammal species whose behavior indicates an internal magnetic compass.
According to a report by Jeremy Hsu at MSNBC, Previous research has shown that animals such as birds, turtles and salmon migrate using a sense of magnetic direction, and small mammals such as rodents and one bat species also have a magnetic compass.
A Europe-wide student movement, started in the Austrian capital of Vienna, is developing.
It started on 28 October 2009 and met with the discussions following the Conference of the Ministers for Education and Cultural Affairs in Germany on 15 October.
For Tuesday 17 November â€” the 70th anniversary of the international students' day â€” a nationwide education strike in Germany has been announced.
Speakers of the actions said, students are complaining that universities are underfunded and understaffed.
The students' protest concerns the Bologna reforms and the tuition fees.
On Wednesday, 11 November some 600 students at the Free University of Berlin had occupied the largest auditorium of the central building of the humanities in the suburb of Dahlem.
Afterwards actions took place in TÃ¼bingen, Munich and Basel, each with hundreds of participants.
The Potthoff building, a lecture hall of the Dresden TU has been occupied since Monday, 9 November.
Actions also took place in Utrecht, Turin, Rome, Lublin, London and Birmingham.
Two men have been charged with starting the Zaca Fire, the second-largest wildfire in the history of California.
The fire is continuing to burn through the Los Padres National Forest, and has consumed a total of 240,000 acres, having started on July 4.
However, the fire is now under control, and is expected to be contained by September 4.
Jose Jesus Cabrera of Santa Ynez, 38, Santiago Iniguez Cervantes of Santa Maria, 46, and the company of Rancho La Laguna, whom they worked for, have all been charged with six counts of felony in relation to starting the fire.
Three of the charges are for recklessly causing a fire that caused great bodily injury.
Two counts of this stem from the crash of a helicopter that was fighting the fires, and the other from a separate incident when a third firefighter was seriously wounded while battling the flames.
The other three counts are for recklessly causing a structure or forest fire, carelessness with a flaming substance and for not having the required permit to operate equipment capable of starting a fire.
The fire started when equipment being used on a blocked water line sparked.
58 firefighters were injured in total by the blaze, although no life-threatening injuries were sustained.
Currently, 1,800 people are involved in firefighting efforts, which have cost a total of $114 million.
A lawyer for the men said he felt the charges were excessive considering the circumstances.
We have a couple of hard working guys who go out to take care of a water pipe or some cattle on a very hot day on the Fourth of July and they took precautions and despite the precautions an accident happened and a fire started, said Attorney Robert Sanger.
If convicted, the men could face up to nine years imprisonment.
There is also the possibility of fines and action to recover the costs of the fire.

To encourage the performance of deaf athletes, the International Committee of Sports for the Deaf (ICSD) recently announced the top 10 finalists for the 2007 WIDEX Sportsman and Sportswomen Award.
According to icCoventry from England and the ICSD, Bagga performed excellently in recent badminton matches, never losing important matches in his international career, which began in 1989.
He was known as a good sportsman; always accepting referees' judgments, regardless of their accuracy.
Recently in the 2nd World Deaf Badminton Championships in Germany, Bagga offered to give up his silver medal in men's single class after the tragic news of his former Lithuanian teammate Andirus Jankus' death in a car accident.
This touched the hearts of many people, both deaf and able.
Best Sportswoman, Deeva, participated in the 2007 World Deaf Swimming Championships in Taiwan and broke 3 world records in the same day.
Al-Qaeda said in a web statement Thursday that it has killed Egypt's top envoy in Iraq, Ihab al-Sherif.
The Islamic terror group released a video showing a blindfolded al-Sherif identifying himself, but did not show his death.
Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak confirmed these reports, but did not say how the government had validated Al-Qaeda's claims.
Mr Al-Sherif, 51, had been serving in Baghdad as chief envoy since early June; he was abducted on 03 July while out buying a newspaper, eyewitnesses said.
He was not accompanied by any security at that time.
After a year of turbulent weather in Mexico and destruction of their habitat, the Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) population could be down by as much as 50% to 60% this year, experts say.
A gathering area for the butterflies northwest of Mexico City was affected particularly hard by severe weather this winter, which killed 50 people in the region.
According to Lincoln Brower, a monarch expert with Sweet Briar College in Virginia, things are in pretty bad shape.
The southbound migration was already the smallest in recorded history, and with the destructive winter, over half of the species' population might have been killed.
This means the numbers going to Texas are going to be down, said Chip Taylor, a professor of entomology at the University of Kansas-Lawrence.
He believes it could take years for the Monarchs to repopulate.
Taylor also said that Weâ€™re talking about significant degradation at overwintering sites; the loss of habitat in the United States and Canada and climate change in Mexico.
Weâ€™ve had three major killing winter storms in the last decade that have never been seen previously.
Weâ€™re dealing with something new here, and thatâ€™s consistent with climate change.
Illegal logging in Mexico and a lack of milkweed in the Midwest United States for the butterflies to lay their eggs in has also taken a toll on the Monarchs' population.
Research published in the journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) suggests a link between male sexuality and conditions in the womb.
Initial research by Dr. Anthony F. Bogaert and his colleagues at Brock University, Ontario revealed a possible link between the number of elder brothers a boy has and the likelihood he is to be gay.
Whether this correlation be attributed to nature through the prenatal effects of the womb or to nurture through the psychosocial effects of growing up with elder siblings, however, remained unclear.
To further his research Bogaert studied 944 heterosexual and homosexual men.
The men were either biological brothers and shared the same mother or non-biological brothers through adoption or as half or step siblings.
Boegart reasoned that if the link between homosexuality and elder brothers was due to the nurturing effects of the family environment it would show regardless of any biological relationship.
The study showed, however, that the link was found only in biological brothers.
The amount of time an individual spent being raised with elder brothers had no bearing on sexual orientation; the relationship was even found to be true in brothers who were raised apart from one another.
Bogaert writes in this month's PNAS These results support a prenatal origin to sexual orientation development in men and indicate that the fraternal birth-order effect is probably the result of a maternal 'memory' for male gestations or births.
He suggests that each male foetus prompts a progressively stronger immune reaction in the mother's body.
The antibodies that are produced by this reaction may account for sexual differentiation of the brain.
Scientists from Michigan State University added in an accompanying article These data strengthen the notion that the common denominator between biological brothers, the mother, provides a prenatal environment that fosters homosexuality in her younger sons.
Increasingly, credible evidence appears to indicate that being gay is genetically determined rather than being a so-called lifestyle choice.
It adds further weight to the argument that lesbian and gay people should be treated equally in society and not discriminated against for something that's just as inherent as skin colour, said Andy Forrest, a spokesman for gay rights group Stonewall.
However; Dr. Bogaert's study made no explanation for the origin of lesbianism.
Only 44.47 percent of Romanian high school students passed last week's 2011 baccalaureate exam, according to the results published by Romanian education authorities on Sunday.
The baccalaureate exam in Romania is the secondary school educational qualification test, and passing it attests that a student has graduated high school and may be admitted to a university.
This is dramatically different from 69.3 percent last year and 81.4 percent in 2009.
Sunday's passing figures are a record low since the exam was introduced in Romania and comes after new anti-fraud measures cut back on student cheating.
These included installing cameras in examination centres and forbidding students from paying teachers to obtain higher scores.
For this exam, 665 high school students were caught cheating, double the number from last year, and at one high school it was found that the exam answers were given to 111 pupils prior to the exam.
Caras Severin County reported the lowest rate with 24.82 percent graduation, and Suceava reported the highest with 65.03 percent, down from 87.39 percent in 2010.
In Bucharest the rate was 42.03 percent, the lowest since the 1989 revolution.
The release of the results started a national debate on the possible causes of the drastic drop in scores, from the failure of parental participation, poor teacher pay and pay cuts, to student disinterest and lack of motivation.
Critics say the educational system depends on rote learning and students are not taught to think independently.
At a press conference on Monday, Education minister Daniel Funeriu said, These results are a mirror of our society.
Romania is now at a crossroads....
The nation should choose to encourage people who like to work rather than those who prefer cheating.
Cristian Alexandrescu, chief education inspector for Bucharest, argued that the exam was not taken seriously by students and the results prove that a student cannot obtain a diploma without effort.
The moment of truth has come, Liliana Romanciuc, a school inspector in north-eastern Romania, told Mediafax.
SKY TV had problems earlier with some viewers unable to tune into certain channels.
It was caused by a streamlining issue not related to satellite problems.
The problem caused the following channels unable to be seen Sky Movies, J2, Cartoon Network, Sky News, pay-per-view movie channels, radio channels including; National Radio, Concert FM and George FM.
Most of the free-to-air channels, however, were working, along with the sport channels, some channels did suffer from picture pixelation.
British author James Graham Ballard, known as J. G. Ballard has died at the age of 78.
Ballard died on Sunday after a long battle with prostate cancer.
According to a spokesperson, Ballard had been sick for several years and that it was with great sadness to have to make the announcement of his death.
Ballard is best known for writing the novels Crash in 1973 and Empire of the Sun in 1984 which won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize.
He had grown up in Shanghai and had very good manners.
He was very generous and polite and it took a long while before he would do anything that wasnâ€™t very controlled, said friend and author Iain Sinclair to The Times.
Ballard was born in Shanghai, China in the Shanghai International Settlement in 1930.
When he was 12, he and his family were forced to live in a camp run by Japanese forces during World War II.
Ballard says that he won't say happy things about his experience in the camp, but also no unpleasant ones either.
In an interview with BBC News, Ballard said I remember a lot of the casual brutality and beatings-up that went on, but at the same time we children were playing a hundred and one games all the time.
In 1946 he moved to the UK with his sister and mother where he began to write.
Twenty years later, in the 1960's, he employed himself as a full time writer.
He produced his first novel in 1961 titled The Wind from Nowhere and The Drowned World just a year later.
The government of Ireland plans to inject â‚¬4 billion each into the Bank of Ireland and the Allied Irish Bank.
An insurance scheme to underwrite bad debts would also be created and the banks will attempt to raise â‚¬1 billion from shareholders.
The two banks have been in need of recapitalization for several weeks.
The deal will see the government take on up to â‚¬24 billion of risk from speculative property loans by the banks.
The government has already moved to nationalize the country's third largest bank, Anglo Irish.
India won the final match of the recent cricket series.
Yuvraj Singh made a unbeaten 107 (93b, 15x4)helping India's , chasing 287, achieved with 19 deliveries remaining on a good batting pitch.
Mahendra Singh Dhoni (77 not out, 56b, 6x4, 4x6) was another important contributor to the Indian Innings.
The Pakistani bowling, apart from a probing spell from paceman Rao Iftekar Anjum, was made to look ordinary.
When on 64, Yuvraj was put down at covers by Shoaib Malik.
Tendulkar carried the drinks, indicating that in this Indian side experience and youth blended into one.
In Tendulkar's absence, Rahul Dravid opened the innings with Gautam Gambhir.
The left-handed Gambhir sparkled with a few pick-up shots on the leg-side; this also showed Pakistan's pacemen were not bowling the right line.
Mohammed Asif has not been a big factor in the ODIs since the away going delivery is a lesser weapon in this variety of the game, especially if a side is bowling in the afternoon.
It was his two-way movement that made him so dangerous in Tests.
Gambhir once again wasted a start, but the opening pair had, importantly, raised 69.
Dravid's 50 (6x4) might have consumed 82 deliveries, but he made sure that, in the absence of Virender Sehwag and Tendulkar, the Indians had enough wickets in hand before they began the final onslaught.
It was Sreesanth who dented Pakistan in the morning after Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar shared the new ball.
The Kerala paceman, who is learning fast, cut down on his pace realising that there was not too much assistance for him from the wicket.
He struck thrice and Pakistan, from 62 without loss, slumped to 77 for three.
In the context of the match, Sreesanth's spell of 5-1-25-3 was crucial.
Both Imran Farhat and Kamran Akmal, after putting together 62, fell to pull shots, and Shoaib Malik steered right into Suresh Raina's hands at gully.
There is fluency about Sreesanth's run-up and action that is hard to ignore, and he did bowl well at the death, swinging the ball into the right-hander.
And off-spinner Ramesh Powar won a leg-before decision against an ominous looking Inzamam on the sweep; the delivery drifted into the right-hander from outside the off-stump and then straightened.
The bowlers, backed by aggressive fielding, had performed a fair job, under the conditions.
High winds and heavy rains have left 4 people dead, and much of the Seattle, Washington area is without electrical power.
A number of large trees have been downed and heavy rains have caused minor flooding in many areas of the city.
According to first-hand reports as many as 1 million people and several large organizations such as Microsoft are without power this morning.
Flood, storm, and strong wind watches were in effect last night as a rare thunderstorm system moved into the Pacific Northwest region, hitting areas from Seattle to Portland with high winds and heavy rains.
Interstate 5 through Seattle was closed at its intersection with Mercer Street due to standing water.
The State Route 520 floating bridge, a major conduit across Lake Washington to the technology-rich Eastside was closed and its drawspan opened to protect it from storm damage well into Friday.
Local roads throughout the region were strewn with debris, especially evergreen branches and leaves.
Four deaths were reported in connection with the storm as of Friday.
A Seattle woman died in the basement of her home after floodwaters caused the basement door to close and jam shut.
Two others died in outlying areas after tall Northwest evergreens fell on their vehicles, and a man in Grays Harbor, near the Pacific coast, died in his sleep after a tree fell on his mobile home.
KOMO news reported a caller saying a 100-foot evergreen had fallen into his house.
Downed trees and high winds also brought down powerlines throughout Western Washington.
Seattle City Light, the municipal electric utility for the city, reported a peak of 175,000 customers without power, most in the north and south ends of the city, as well as the east edge of town and the Green Lake area.
Puget Sound Energy, the electric utility for much of the Seattle metro area, reported 700,000 customers (over 66%) without power, with the area around Seattle the worst hit.
PSE, which had already enlisted additional powerline workers from neighboring states, did not send crews out until mid Friday morning due to continued high winds.
Estimates for power restoration were anywhere from a few days to over a week.
Island County, at the mouth of Puget Sound, was completely without power.
Schools in Seattle and throughout its suburbs were closed Friday, many due to power outages.
The city of Mercer Island, connected to the mainland only by Interstate 90, is reportedly inaccessible.
The Seattle Post-Intelligencer failed to print due to power failures at the printing facility, which had redundant power feeds from both the Seattle utility as well as PSE.
It is the first time in 70 years that the paper has not been printed.
The Seattle Times, a competing paper under a joint operating agreement, managed to print only 13,000 copies of its regular circulation of over 200,000.
The papers located alternate facilities to print a reduced version of their Saturday editions, and their joint Sunday issue was also expected to be reduced.
At Sea-Tac Airport, three terminals were shut down overnight due to the storm.
Concourse A and the South Satellite terminal lost power, and a blown-out window caused Concourse C to also close.
All terminals were back in working order by midday Friday.
Likewise, in Oregon, Portland International Airport reported at least 40 flights cancelled.
At Seattle's Boeing Field, winds flipped a private plane over, colliding with another plane.
The Seattle Seahawks vs. San Francisco 49ers football game was delayed 15 minutes.
A pre-game power surge temporarily took the Qwest Field's video displays offline.
The gridiron was plagued by standing water, as the stadium's loudspeakers played Who'll Stop The Rain shortly before kickoff.
Thursday night's storm comes after a previous regional storm in the Seattle area earlier in the week, in which trees in a few Seattle suburbs fell onto roads, powerlines, and two school buses.
In those incidents no one was hurt, and there were a few spotty power outages.
This is the second serious storm to hit the Northwest since Thanksgiving, In late November, record-setting snowfall had a similar disabling effect on the region.
The British tabloid The Daily Mirror today suggested that the London bombers may not have planned to commit suicide, while a Scotland Yard spokesman said they have not definitely confirmed that the four men intended to die when they carried out the attacks.
The Daily Mirror claims that the bombers brought return rail tickets to Luton, and that they purchased pay and display car park tickets before boarding the train at Luton Station.
The tabloid paper also states how the bombers all had personal items on their person at the time of the attacks, such as wallets, driving licences and bank cards.
It also states how they were carrying large rucksacks which could be easily dumped, instead of having the explosives strapped to their bodies, as would be expected of a suicide bomber.
It also points to evidence from the bombers' families, where two of the men had pregnant wives.
From this evidence, the paper draws the conclusion that the four men were not told the bombs would detonate straight away, and that the men thought they would be able to escape unscathed.
This was probably done to protect their master's identity, the paper suggested, since there was a high probability the bombers would be caught had they lived.
A string of anti-government protests in Bangkok yesterday resulted in at least one fatality, numerous others injured, and the temporary closure of several foreign embassies in Thailand.
Philip Crowley, a spokesperson for the US State Department, announced early Thursday morning that the US embassy would be closed to the public due to its location near the violence.
The embassy will be operating with a reduced staff and will not offer American citizens services until the conflict is resolved.
The British and Dutch embassies in Thailand also halted their services after the Thai government said that it would seal off the area.
The leader of the protests was fugitive Major-General Khattiya Sawasdipol, the radical leader of the militant Red Shirt movement.
While giving interviews with foreign journalists, Sawasdipol appeared to have been shot in the head by a sniper.
He was later taken to a local hospital for emergency treatment.
One other protester, 25-year-old Chartchai Bualao, was killed in the incident, but it is still unclear as to who is responsible for the shooting.
Thai military forces moved in quickly to suppress the protesters just after the shooting, aiming to put down the opposition movement and secure the area in which they had barricaded themselves since early April.
The Thai government declared a state of emergency for seventeen of the country's 76 provinces in the wake of the protests.
This incident is only the latest in an ongoing series of violent outbreaks among protesters and the Thai government.
The violence is a result of the belief of the protesters that Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva took power through illegitimate means with the support of the Thai military.
Following the escalation of investigations into St Stanislaus College in Bathurst, New South Wales, Australia, Wikinews has obtained a police statement from an alleged victim made in 1997 against priest Brian Joseph Spillane.
It had been believed that Bathurst detectives set up Strike Force Header after receiving a complaint from a former St Stanislaus student last year.
The complainant came to the police's attention after he came to Bathurst handing out fliers documenting alleged abuses at the school and providing a link to a website he had set up.
St Stanislaus College contacted police and asked them to investigate.
Police contacted the alleged victim and asked him if he would like to make a complaint.
In the statement obtained by Wikinews, the same man complained to detectives at Kalgoorlie, Western Australia about abuse by Spillane at St Stanislaus.
In the graphic statement, he describes abuse which began following a poker game with the priest at the centre of the allegations.
Bathurst Police refused to comment when contacted about the statement today.
Two lawyers of accused drug dealer Luiz Fernando da Costa (also known as Fernando Beira-Mar) were arrested Sunday November 14 in a restaurant located at Rio de Janeiro city in Brazil.
They have been accused of bribing Brazilian federal police officers.
Luiz Fernando da Costa, known as Fernando Beira-Mar or Fernandinho Beira-Mar, is one of the biggest drug dealers of Latin America according to police.
Beira-Mar was arrested by the Colombian army at April 20-21, 2001, in a FARC camp located at a forest near Colombia and Venezuela and then transferred to Brazil where he is been in prison until now.
The King of Jordan, King Abdullah, dissolved the country's parliament on Tuesday, half-way through its four year term, and called for early general elections to be held, up to two years ahead of schedule.
The monarch did not immediately provide a reason for the move; however, there have recently been reports accusing the parliament of handling legislation ineptly, and even of being corrupt.
The king's decree ordered the civil service to host new elections to replace the 110-member parliament, although an exact date for the polls hasn't yet been named.
Critics of the parliament have said that its members didn't properly address issues such as unemployment and poverty.
The opposition, however, asserted that the house had been disbanded so that the government could use emergency laws to pass legislation.
King Abdullah has now disbanded the parliament two times since he came to power in 1999.
At approximately 0026 hrs, on Wednesday, March 22, the British Columbia ferry MV Queen of the North hit a rock near Gil Island in Wright Sound, off the coast of British Columbia, Canada, 75 from the start of ship's scheduled journey from Prince Rupert to Port Hardy on the Northern tip of Vancouver Island.
The ship missed a course change and ran agroung off Gil Island.
It took about an hour for the ferry to sink, giving passengers time to get out.
The vessel was carrying 101 passengers and crew, and all but 2 were accounted for.
Thanks to quick-response of nearby aboriginal fishing villager of Hartley Bay, and the CCGS Sir Wiflrid Laurier.
Survivors were quickly fetched from the Queen of the North's lifeboat and brought to Hartley Bay and onboard the coast Guard ship, and eventually back to Prince Rupert onboard the Sir Wilfrid Laurier.
The Queen of the North, is (apx) 9,000 gross ton, motor driven vessel, built in Germany in 1969.
The Queen of the North had been on this 15 hrs, 274 nautical mile ferry run since late May 1980.
In the summer and on relief work, her smaller sister ship, the Queen of Prince Rupert also performs that run.
Former Russian nuclear energy minister Yevgeny Adamov was arrested on Monday by Swiss authorities.
The arrest came at the request of U.S. officials who claim he stole more than nine million dollars allocated by Washington to help improve Russian nuclear safety.
The Ministry of Justice in Switzerland said Adamov will be extradited to the US.
The warrant allowing this states that he is charged with diverting money from the U.S. Department of Energy to several companies he controls.
Adamov's lead lawyer said he will fight the extradition warrant and called the accusations baseless.
Adamov, who has on a number of occasions been investigated for his financial dealing by the U.S. and Russia alike, said he was being punished for his help in building a nuclear plant in Iran.
The U.S. now has 60 days to present a formal request, after which a Swiss court will make a ruling.
Swiss officials said it is common for this process to take several months.
Adamov's U.S. lawyer, Larry Breur, said Adamov admitted to depositing the money into a personal account, but then he used that account to dispense the money to Russian agencies and nuclear scientists.
Breur said the process was common in Russia to avoid hypertaxation.
Yevgeny Adamov was a minister in Boris Yeltsin's government, but was removed from power by Vladimir Putin in an effort to remove corruption.
Adamov was in Bern attempting to unblock bank accounts belonging to his daughter.
Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar registered yesterday as a candidate in the parliamentary by-election.
She is contesting, for her party the National League for Democracy (NLD), for Kawhmu, among the 48 seats in the election scheduled in April.
Suu Kyi is to contest in elections for the first time.
Her party won the 1990 election, but she was under house arrest.
The military junta did not accept NLD's majority in that election.
The NLD objected to electoral laws and boycotted 2010 elections.
Kawhmu is a rural township in south-west Myanmar which was hit by cyclone Nargis in 2008.
Suu Kyi's party would not have much power even if it won all the 48 available seats in the election.
Nevertheless, her participation could be a test for democratic reforms in Myanmar.
The National Anti-Hail Program was launched in 2000 and is due to be finalised in 2014.
It seeks to better protect those areas of the country that are most affected by hail.
The project needs investment of 10.9 million new lei (3 million euro), half of which have already been allocated, according to the project's co-ordinator, Stancu Samoila.
Carl-Henric Svanberg, CEO of Ericsson, began a tour of some of Marconi's European sites this morning, starting at Coventry and moving to Beeston for the afternoon session.
Genoa and Backnang will be visited on Wednesday and Thursday.
Mike Parton, CEO of Marconi Corporation, spoke of the 'good news' for all stake-holders and introduced Svanberg to a round of applause from the majority of the staff at Coventry New Century Park, while more staff from Coventry New Horizon Park listened on a conference call line.
The purpose of the tour is to communicate to approx. Eighty percent of Marconi's staff and allow them to ask questions about the asset purchase proposed by Ericsson.
Dutch adventurer Ralph Tuijn has reached the halfway point of his attempt to be the first person to row across the Pacific Ocean unaided.
The 16,000 kilometre journey from the coast of Peru to the seaside city of Brisbane, Australia, the widest section of the Pacific, has never been crossed absolutely unaided by a rower, and Tuijn says just nine people have rowed it even with assistance.
Tuijn reached the central point of his crossing, an insignificant point of water in the ocean, 111 days after setting off from Peru in March.
He has been making good progress, and has since cut his estimated time of arrival in Brisbane by a month.
The Dutchman, who now expects to reach his destination on October 20, has kept in touch with those tracking his movements through daily internet postings from his laptop computer, including his wife Winnie.
His boat, the Zeeman Challenger, is a seven-metre custom plywood vessel.
Tuijn has overcome a variety of obstacles to reach the halfway point.
He is suffering from the constant attention of sharks, who often bump his boat and disrupt his attempts at sleep.
One particular shark, dubbed 'Gomulka' by Tuijn, has been trailing the adventurer's boat for extended periods.
He has also accidentally burnt himself when he spilled hot water on his foot whilst trying to make coffee, apparently also from a shark 'bump'.
He is also forced to manually pump water for cooking and drinking after his automatic water pump broke down not long into his journey.
His vessel has no motors or sails, but relies on his physical rowing power to move.
The boat does have a solar power system to provide energy for his laptop, a telephone and a global positioning system.
Tujin, who is raising money for a children's home in Mumbai, India, is rowing at an average speed of 58 kilometres each day.
His diet consists of freeze-dried foods and fish, which are keeping him physically well-conditioned despite tiring mentally.
He has rowed across the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, as well as cycled across Russia and the icy terrain of Greenland.
Russian president Dmitry Medvedev followed the president of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili and signed the ceasefire agreement on Saturday.
The peace plan document was originally drafted by Nicolas Sarkozy, the President of France.
Medvedev announced during a meeting of the Russian Security Council that he had signed the document .
The truce was signed by Saakashvili on Friday, after a meeting with US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
Following the meeting, a press conference was held in which Saakashvili stated that he had signed the accord.
But he pointed out that this is not a done deal.
We need to do our utmost to deter such behaviour in the future.
By signing the agreement, both sides agree to pull back their forces to pre-conflict positions.
The accord allows certain concessions to both Georgia and Russia.
Initially Medvedev said that he had ordered Russian troops to begin leaving Georgia on August 11.
However, the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov refused to put a timetable on the withdrawal of Russian forces from deep inside Georgia and stated that their departure depended on extra security measures being put in place.
Lavrov also said Russia would strengthen its contingent in South Ossetia.
In a letter to Saakashvili, Nicolas Sarkozy confirmed that according to the signed peace plan, Russian forces are obliged to withdraw from all major Georgian towns regardless of the additional security measures mentioned in the document.
According to Sarkozy, these additional measures refer to the border area only.
At the same time Georgian internal affairs ministry reported that Russian forces changed the administrative borders of Abkhazia, and captured one of the Georgian power plants in the area.
It is also reported that Russian forces destroyed the strategic Georgian rail bridge in Kaspi.
According to Lavrov, the document Saakashvili signed differed from the one signed by Medvedev, lacking its introductory part.

Two protesters in the United States who are associated with the 'Tar Sands Blockade' were arrested Monday after they barricaded themselves inside a portion of the Keystone Oil Pipeline under construction in Winona, Texas.
TransCanada, which owns the pipeline, stopped construction once the protest began.
TransCanada Corporation didn't bother to ask the people of this neighborhood if they wanted to have millions of gallons of poisonous tar sands pumped through their backyards, said one of the protesters inside the pipeline, Matt Almonte in a statement posted to the group's website.
This multinational corporation has bullied landowners and expropriated homes to fatten its bottom line, added Almonte.
Glen Collins, the second protester said, I'm barricading this pipe with Tar Sands Blockade today to say loud and clear to the extraction industry that our communities and the resources we depend on for survival are not collateral damage.
According to their website www.tarsandsblockade.org, Almonte and Collins entered the pipeline prior to about 730 a.m. local time.
They went 25 feet into the pipeline and took with them two barrels filled with cement, weighing 600 pounds each and locked themselves in between them.
At around noon, police on scene entered the section of pipe, only to emerge a few minutes later without the protesters.
At 1230, after an ambulance arrived on scene, police once again entered the pipe and began to pull on one of the barrels.
They were successfully removed and both Almonte and Collins were arrested.
A short time later a third protester, identified as Isabel Indigo Brooks, was also arrested.
In a statement to Wikinews, spokesperson for TransCanada Grady Semmens called the incident unfortunate saying, This project is about supplying Canadian and American oil to U.S. refineries, pushing out more expensive crude oil from foreign regimes that do not support American values of freedom and common sense â€” Libya, Venezuela and the Middle East.
It is unfortunate these protestors are trying to keep thousands of Americans from the jobs they depend on to provide for their families.
This project is important not only to thousands of workers but also to Americans in general, added Semmens.
Construction on portions of the pipeline were halted in January when the White House denied permits for it to be finished.
This announcement is not a judgment on the merits of the pipeline, but the arbitrary nature of a deadline that prevented the State Department from gathering the information necessary to approve the project and protect the American people, said President Barack Obama in January.
The portion of the pipeline affected by the protesters is part of the 'Gulf Coast Pipeline Project' that is to be about 485 miles long and consist of a 36-inch crude oil pipeline beginning in Cushing, Oklahoma and extending south to Nederland, Texas, says TransCanada on their website.
British architect Norman Foster and FC Barcelona president Joan Laporta presented today in Barcelona the redevelopment project for the team's stadium, Camp Nou, built in 1957.
The Catalan club expects that this redesign will turn the stadium into a city landmark and that the external image of the stadium will become a recognized brand for FCB.
The new stadium will be wrapped in a colourful mosaic made up of the team's colours (blue and red) and those of the Catalan flag (red and yellow) and reminiscent of Gaudi's style.
This reptile-like cover of tiles and lights will allow the stadium to transform itself according to the time of day and the events taking place.
The project also includes the building of a retractable roof.
According to the Club, the remodelled stadium is designed such that it can be built with minimal disruption to FCB normal football activity.
The United States' first major blizzard of the winter season has left much of the New England region covered in snow.
Stretching from Virginia to Maine, the storm, packing winds of over 50 miles per hour (80.5 kilometres per hour), dropped more than two feet of snow in some areas.
Residents prepared for what would be one of the worst nor'easters in quite some time.
The storm contained similar conditions to a category 2 hurricane.
Wellfleet, Massachusetts saw an 80 miles per hour wind gust, the strongest recorded throughout the storm.
Connecticut, New York and Maine all recorded wind gusts of over 60 miles per hour and gusts of over 70 miles per hour blasted Cape Cod.
A total of 32 inches (81.3 centimetres) fell in Rahway, part of the hardest-hit state in the storm's path.
Most New Jersey cities received over a foot of snow, while Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, and Maryland all had snow totals topping out at around 1 foot (30.48 centimetres) with Massachusetts topping out at a foot and a half.
On Monday, travel proved difficult, with flights from Philadelphia, Newark, New York City, Hartford, Boston, Portland, and Washington, D.C. canceled.
Drivers also ran into problems on major highways as accidents were unavoidable on the slick roads.
Japanese media reported that Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi suggested yesterday that the government would submit a draft to the Diet to rewrite the Imperial Household Act within the next year.
This is in response to a board of experts who have been investigating the succession issue.
The experts' Board on the Imperial Household Act, personally appointed by the Prime Minister, reached an agreement on the issue that an Empress should be accepted.
Implementation of their recommendations would mean that succession to the highest position in Japanese society would occur without a gender bias.
At the present time, the Japanese imperial household has no male member under the age of 20; present law only allows male descendants to ascend to the Chrysanthemum Throne.
The proposed solution would put Princess Aiko, the sole child of Crown Prince Naruhito and Crown Princess Masako in place as the most likely to inherit the position of monarch, following behind would be Princess Sayako who will leave the Imperial Household due to her planned marriage with a commoner.
Present law in Japan defines the succession as favouring male children; the last time the country had an Empress was in 1771, when Empress Go-Sakuramachi abdicated to her nephew.
Despite the fact that there is precedent for an Empress, some scholars have suggested family members who previously broke ties with the recognised royal family following the end of World War II should be considered for the succession, opening up the field of candidates even more.
The group of scholars proposing this solution have stressed that their solution is aimed at maintaining the tradition of a male heir.
Amongst the aftermath of a magnitude 8.9 earthquake which struck on Friday, followed by a tsunami, Naoto Kan, the prime minister of Japan, claimed that the country is experiencing its largest difficulties since the end of World War II in 1945.
Kan reported that there were limited supplies of electricity due to the closure of numerous power stations, including a nuclear power plant located in Fukushima Prefecture.
According to NHK, a broadcasting organization in Japan, approximately 310,000 individuals have been transported to safety in shelters that, in various cases, do not contain electricity.
The Government of Japan has reported the deaths of one thousand individuals, although thousands of others have not been taken into account.
The police have claimed that the death toll in the Miyagi Prefecture as a result of the earthquake and tsunami could be in excess of ten thousand.
100,000 troops - which equates to approximately 40% of the country's armed forces - are said to have been committed to assisting with the survivors of the disasters.
The nuclear agency of Japan consider the circumstances at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant to be Level 4 on the International Nuclear Event Scale, which is an accident with local consequences.
According to BBC News Online, incidents like this usually cause one person to die from causes related to radiation.
No individuals from the power plant are reported to have died.
In the NHL the Buffalo Sabres beat the New York Islanders 3-0 in a shutout on Thursday night to tie the NHL record for the best start to a season.
I think we're all proud of what we've accomplished so far.
But at the end of the day, it's not what we're aiming for down the road, said Daniel Briere, the co-captain for the Sabres.
We want to be having these kinds of streaks in the playoffs.
I think it will serve us well in the future, but right now we just need the points, said Ryan Miller, one of the Sabres goalies.
Currently Buffalo is 10-0-0 and is currently the top team in the NHL.
They will play the Atlanta Thrashers, who trail the Sabres by only 3 points in the NHL overall, on Saturday October 28.
Beginning at the end of last season, the Sabres have won 15 games in a row.
The U.S. House of Representatives approved the building of 700 miles of double-layered fence between the U.S. and Mexico this afternoon, it was the second time in a year that the issue was before the congress and the bill passed by a 238â€“138 vote.
The 2000 mile long border currently has 75 miles of fencing.
The bill also orders the U.S. Homeland Security Department to take over control of the border in 18 months and grants border agents new authority to stop fleeing vehicles.
It also ordered the Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff to conduct a study of the necessity and feasibility of the construction of a state-of-the-art barrier system along the Canadian border.
Oil prices attained a six-month high on Friday, on new signs that the U.S. economy may not be contracting as fast as was believed.
U.S. crude oil prices reached US$66.47 a barrel, a level not seen since last November.
Brent North Sea crude oil was up $1.13 to $65.52 at the end of the week, after peaking at $65.70, also the highest level since November.
This comes soon after a report released by the U.S. Commerce Department showed that the U.S. GDP fell by 5.7%, revised from the original figure of 6.1%.
Analysts predict that oil prices will continue to rise amid more positive economic news, especially from economic giants such as India and Japan.
Oil market participants' conclusion that the worst of the recession has passed and that a recovery in demand must be at hand was bolstered overnight by higher than expected first quarter growth in India and a sharp jump in Japan's April industrial production, said MF Globa's John Kilduff.
We've got a lot more optimism about the economic outlook than we did.
The market is factoring in a recovery in demand by the end of the year, said an analyst for the Commodity Warrants Australia, Toby Hassall.
The Sunday Times cites unnamed U.K. government sources saying that Britain's troops could leave Basra as early as October.
This alleged scenario would allow Gordon Brown to announce a troop withdrawal in a statement at the time MPs return to Parliament.
The speculations have sparked criticism from U.S. military commentators this weekend.
General Jack Keane said the withdrawal had much more to do with conditions in the U.K. than with the situation in Iraq.
Frederick Kagan, of the American Enterprise Institute, said the expected withdrawal highlights the growing divergence between the British and American approach.
Just yesterday, former General Sir Mike Jackson called Donald Rumsfeld's approach to the U.S. presence in Iraq intellectually bankrupt.
An official statement from the British Ministry of Defence said that decisions about the number of troops in the Southern Iraqi province would take into account the position of the Iraqi and U.S. government.
The Ministry said that even after a competent Iraqi security force will have replaced them, some troops could still remain in Basra.
Until now, Gordon Brown has consistently refused to set a time table for a pull-back.
The upper house of the former Kyrgyz parliament declared it was terminating its work to stabilize the situation and do away with conflicts on Tuesday, as the lower house had done a day before.
The decision was signed by 32 of the 45 deputies.
We think we have fulfilled our task, as far as was possible, especially in this time of trials, they said.
A huge part of the state system was devoted to the election process.
That is not a secretâ€¦
We have all seen what happens when the executive branch gets involved in elections.
I think we will not get into that now â€¦
I think that staff should get back to work, he said.
Whoever is ... on my staff, if I hear that they got promoted for money or because they are someone's relative, or they belong to particular clan, then this person will be removed immediately, he added.
We will set up public hotline so that people can complain against corruption, he told them.
Meanwhile, deposed president Askar Akayev's supporters said they would form a party and run a candidate in the presidential poll.
Ousted emergencies minister Timirbek Akmataliyev and interior minister Keshenbek Dyushenbayev said they were forming the Akyikat (Fairness) political party.
A man in Rotorua today was shot after being involved in a crash outside the Rotorua International Stadium.
Witnesses said that one man pulled out a handgun and shot another man in the head.
Witness Alby King said I just heard this big car crash, and we had a look and there was two guys fighting, and one just shot the other in the back of the head.
The man, who was shot, survived the shooting and is in serious but stable condition at hospital.
The police say they have arrested a 38-year-old in relation to the shooting, he was found in a street nearby after fleeing the scene.
The police would not comment on whether or not it was a gang-related incident.
In the lead-up to the federal election on September 7, both leaders were focused on refugee policy with Abbott attacking Rudd for failing to effectively protect the country's borders by disbanding border protection agreements implemented by the previous Liberal government.
It's because Mr. Rudd closed it all down that we've had more than 50,000 illegal arrivals, claimed Abbott.
There has been more than 800 boats, 11 billion dollars in budget blow-outs and tragically, more than 1000 deaths at sea.
Rudd claimed that the policy he'd put forward has one simple principle behind it If you are a people smuggler bringing someone to Australia and you are seeking to settle them in Australia, we will not allow it.
They will be sent for processing in Papua New Guinea.
Rudd also used the debate to take a firm stance on same-sex marriage.
Pledging that a bill to legalise same-sex marriage would be introduced within 100 days of government, Rudd promised to allow a full conscience vote if he were to be re-elected.
Rudd called on the opposition to do the same, describing it as a mark of decency and stating that folk out there want this to happen.
Abbott, however, agreed that while same-sex marriage was an important issue, the economy was a more significant issue.
The Nine Network has announced the death of one of Australia's richest men, Kerry Packer, aged 68.
Announcer Richard Wilkins said on the Today Show that he had just been handed official confirmation of Mr Packer's death at 68.
He said a statement from Tony Ritchie, Nine head of news, said Mrs Kerry Packer and her children James and Gretel sadly report the passing last evening of her husband and their father Kerry.
He died peacefully at home with his family at his bedside.
Packer was the major shareholder in Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL) which owns the Nine television network and Australian Consolidated Press, the producer of many Australian and New Zealand magazines.
Packer was also involved in the gambling and tourism industries and owned the Crown Casino in Melbourne.
In the 1970s, his World Series Cricket revolutionised cricket, bringing One-day cricket to the fore by introducing things such as coloured uniforms, white balls & daynight matches.
Business Review Weekly magazine estimated Packer's net worth at AU$6.5 billion in 2004.
Another famous rich Australian media magnate, who may have lost his Australian nationality, is Rupert Murdoch.
Vornado Realty Trust of Paramus NJ has completed a deal to take a majority interest in the 1.8 million sq ft building at 555 California St in San Francisco, (aka The Bank of America Center) and the 2 million sq. foot building located at 1290 Avenue of The Americas in New York City.
In an announced deal worth $1.8 billion, the new investors get a 70 percent interest in both towers, alleviating the current owners, Hudson Waterfront Associates of any possible liability in a lawsuit brought against them by Donald Trump.
Built in 1969, 555 California is SF's largest office tower, and 2nd tallest building at 779 ft. just a few feet shy of the 48 story Transamerica Pyramid at 853 ft which was completed in 1972.
The SF structure, whose current deal estimates it's value @ $575 per sq ft, had just sold last year for $1.05 Billion all by itself ($583 a sq ft), when property magnate Walter Shorenstein sold it to Henry Cheng and Vincent Lo's Hong Kong based Hudson Waterfront Associates, a record for a city property.
Before 2005, 555 California had been Bank of America's World HQ, but that status ended when North Carolina based NationsBank ate up A.P Giannini's west coast banking legacy and kept the B of A name, but made the main HQ in Charlotte NC.
For lookee loos the 52nd floor of 555 California features the popular Carnelian Room, a hang for well to do bankers, brokers, lawyers and tourists checking out wide sweeping views from what was once the tallest structure west of the Mississippi, now only the 5th Tallest Bldg on the west coast, but still impressive.
For those afraid of heights and the tab for fine dining, the ground floor also features a Starbucks.
At least one woman was injured after a letter bomb exploded inside the Capita Group Plc building on Victoria Street, near Scotland Yard which is located in the central part of London, England.
The woman was holding the bomb when it exploded and suffered injuries to her stomach and hands.
We were called at around 9.40 this morning to reports of a suspect package at a business address in Victoria Street, said a spokesperson for Scotland Yard.
Victoria Street has been shutdown from Westminster Abbey to Scotland Yard while rescuers and police investigate the incident.
As a precaution, a cordon has been put in place around the scene, said another police spokesperson.
The bomb was inside a jiffy bag which held the letter which was contained inside a padded envelope.
The woman who was injured was not believed to be the target.
Police will not say to whom the letter was addressed.
There are no reports of other injuries or deaths so far.
We are not in a position to discuss who may or may not be responsible at this stage, said police.
President Xanana GusmÃ£o has taken special security powers in a bid to quell the violence raging in East Timor.
The period of emergency rule, which would last 30 days, was imposed to prevent violence and avoid further fatalities and lead to rapid reestablishment of public order.
At least 27 people have been killed, criminal documents reported stolen, and looting widespread in the East Timorese capital, Dili during the present period of unrest.
The Australian military commander in East Timor, Brigadier Michael Slater has called the mobs gutless thugs.
Mr Alkatiri was unable to stop the rioting that followed the government's decision in March to lay-off 600 soldiers when they refused to work, complaining of discrimination.
As the disorder grew during April and May, East Timor appealed for international assistance.
Justice Minister Domingos Sarmento said that Portugal had offered to provide East Timor with 120 security personnel by the weekend.
A cleanup effort is underway after torrential downpours on Friday, September 4 caused significant flooding in the north-east of Scotland.
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) said that the weather forecast in the coming days was improving, with no large amounts of rainfall predicted.
Over 500 homes had to be evacuated in Moray after the River Spey and River Lossie started to overflow their banks.
400 homes were also evacuated in the Elgin area and 50 more in Fochabers.
Other areas affected included Aberdeen, Dyce, Lossiemouth and Rothes, where 25 homes had to be evacuated.
The Grampian Police and Tayside Police advised residents not to drive unless absolutely necessary.
In some places, a month's worth of rain had fallen in just 24 hours.
About 67 millimetres of rain had fallen in Aberdeen - roughly the equivalent of an average month of rainfall.
In Lossiemouth, the rainfall was 76.4 millimetres - 15mm more than the average amount every month.
As cleanup efforts progressed, Chief executive of Moray Council Alistair Keddie said, Everything possible was done to protect residents.
However, some residents of the local areas are not so certain.
Mary Campbell, 62 from Fochabers said to the Times Online that she was calling [for help] from 8pm but no-one showed up until about midnight.
All the time the river kept going up and up.
They came with sandbags, but by then it was too late.
The MSP for Moray Angus Robertson MP stated, Water levels are higher than I have ever seen them before and communities have rallied to support people whose homes and businesses have been flooded.
The objective must now be for everyone to help the victims of the worst flooding to hit Moray for many years to assist them rebuild their lives and get back to normality as quickly as possible.
The hard lessons learnt from this latest devastation include the need for local agencies to redouble their efforts to get flood prevention measures into place and to recognise that climate change will only lead to more flooding in the future.
The New Zealand Government has been forced to act because of a letter sent to Prime Minister Helen Clark which claimed that the disease Foot and Mouth is being intentionally spread on Waiheke Island.
The letter, which is assumed to be a hoax, could have a major impact on New Zealand's meat industry.
Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton went so far as to say that the suspension of meat exports by some countries was a real possibility.
The incubation period of foot and mouth disease is such that if animals have been infected, signs should be evident within ten days.
In the meantime, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry experts and veterinarians, many with experience gained in the recent United Kingdom outbreak, are conducting intensive monitoring of the Island's susceptible animals.
All sheep and cattle are being individually inspected every 48 hours.
Meanwhile, restrictions on the movement of livestock are in place, so that in the very unlikely event that there has been a release of the disease, the effects will be contained.
Police efforts are underway to track the origin of the letter that initiated the scare.
The Mexican government has said that an AeromÃ©xico Boeing-737, flight 576 from Cancun, was hijacked and landed safely at Mexico City International Airport in Mexico City.
The situation ended without incident and all passengers and crew on board the aircraft were able to leave safely.
All hijackers were arrested after Mexican security forces boarded the plane.
The incident began just after 130 p.m. (CDT) one man took control of the plane and demanded to speak to Felipe Calderon, Mexico's president.
The hijacker said that if his demand was not met, he would blow up the plane.
Earlier reports had stated there were explosives on board the aircraft, but none were found.
A short time later, four of the detained men were released without being charged.
Authorities identified the sole hijacker as Jose Mar Flores, 44, who is being described as an alcoholic, drug addicted, religious fanatic.
He claims he was on a mission to warn Mexico that an earthquake was going to strike the country.
Flores said that the significance of the date, 9909, the reverse of 666, was the reason why he hijacked the plane.
Reports say he was carrying a box that he described as a bomb and would detonate it if his demand to speak to Calderon about the quake was not met.
104 people were on board the plane, but all passengers and crew aboard the aircraft have left it safely.
The airport remained open while the plane was dealt with on an emergency runway.
Calderon was inside the airport's presidential hangar waiting to depart when the plane landed.
Margaret Wilson was appointed as Speaker of The House of Representatives.
She becomes New Zealand's first female Speaker of the House.
She also rounds out the top positions within New Zealand being taken by women.
All four of Governor-General, Prime Minister, Chief Justice and the Speaker of the House are female.
Clem Simich (National MP) received 37 and ACT MP Ken Shirley got five votes.
The position has usually been appointed unopposed, but the other two candidates stood to protest at the lack of consultation by Prime Minister Helen Clark.
Wilson takes over from Jonathan Hunt, who leaves to become the High Commissioner for New Zealand in London.
Hunt will remain in the backbenches until early next month.
Wilson was previously Attorney-General, a position that Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Michael Cullen now holds.

Families of Spanish sailors being held for over a month appealed to Spain's government on Friday to negotiate with the Somali pirates for their release.
The kidnappers have threatened to kill three of the tuna trawler's crew after a stand-off with Spanish forces.
They called upon the government to free two captured Somalis held in Spain, who are suspected of being involved in the seizure of the Alakrana and its crew of 36.
As in the case with the Lynn Rival, a British yacht, the kidnappers have demanded their release.
Ricardo Blach, the captain of the trawler who is being held by the pirates, warned relatives by phone that they intended to kill the three crew membersâ€”moved from the trawler on Thursday and returned on Friday in a bid to pressure the Spanish governmentâ€”should their demands not be met.
They have just told us that if in three days there is no change over the two held in Spain, they will kill the three and then three others and then more, he said.
The Spanish government has ruled this out, but is willing to hand them over to an African country, such as Kenya, as happened in May.
That is an issue for the courts to decide, commented Deputy Prime Minister MarÃ­a Teresa FernÃ¡ndez de la Vega Sanz to reporters, adding that talking about this technical topic which is legally very complicated was risky.
Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Ãngel Moratinos stressed the need for calm amongst the tension of the removal and return of the three hostages.
What does this mean
 It means we must remain calm.
Kidnappings are complicated situations, with highs and lows, they are very difficult and stressful.
But we must remain confident and calm, he said during a news conference.
If we remain calm and confident I am certain that what all Spaniards want, what the families want, what the government wantsâ€”that the hostages can return to their homes safe and sound and this kidnapping ends satisfactorily.
Families say the captured crew have little drinking water or food,.
They called for Spanish authorities to act immediately and do everything possible to bring home the 36 fishermen.
We demand that all the parties work in the same direction and requested that the Spanish government chooses negotiation as opposed to risking the life of the crew in danger by forceful means.
The pirates captured the boat on October 2, and are demanding US$4 (â‚¬2.6) million in ransom in addition to the release of the two captured Somalis.
The crew comprises sixteen Spaniards, the crew includes eight Indonesians and members from Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Senegal and the Seychelles.
Spanish military captured the two suspected pirates when they left the trawler via a small boat.
On Friday, Spain's secretary of state for defence, Constantino Mendez, insisted that their release is not negotiable.
He announced on Spanish National Radio that the hostages are in good health and that the kidnappers are dramatising the situation as a negotiating tactic.
Two Spanish frigates are observing the situation off the Somali coast.
Queensland Australia's Sir Joh Bjelke Petersen, a controversial figure who served as the State's Premier for 19 years and reigned over the government that later became the subject of the Fitzgerald Inquiry, has died in hospital at Kingaroy, aged 94.
By any measurement, Sir Joh was an exceptional state builder who will be remembered for consistently placing Queensland first, said the Australian Governor General, Major General Jeffery, in a statement.
Australian Prime Minister, John Howard He was certainly a strong political figure and I extend my condolences to his wife and his family.
But not all voices were sympathetic, prominent Queensland Aboriginal activist Sam Watson for example Aboriginal people will always remember him as a racist, a thug and a dictator.
Having suffered severe ill-health for some weeks, and declining health for years, Sir Joh passed away at around 6pm AEST.
He was surrounded by his family, who had been summoned yesterday by Lady Flo, his wife and one-time Senator, for final goodbyes.
Phrases such as Don't you worry about that and Goodness gracious me were like trademarks to the maverick leader.
Known simply as 'Joh' to many, he would famously describe press conferences as 'feeding the chooks'.
Today Kingaroy locals taunted waiting press with cries from You're chooks, you're chooks, ha ha to Go home, ya vultures, and some obscenities, reported the Courier-Mail of Brisbane.
His fall from power at the end of the 80s was surrounded in controversy, with the state embroiled in corruption findings going to the level of his deputies, and Bjelke Petersen's claims of ignorance coming under challenge with charges of perjury.
The case was never heard due to a controversial hung jury the foreman of the jury, Luke Shaw, had been an office-bearer of the Young Nationals â€” an arm of Bjelke Petersen's National Party â€” as well as a member of a group calling themselves 'Friends of Joh'.
Having had his start in life as a peanut farmer in remote Kingaroy, the former Premier was fit up until the very end, but palsy was paralyzing his muscles and organs, to which he eventually succumbed.
Throughout his life Sir Joh combined enormous energy, vision and an immense capacity for hard work, most especially during his 19-year term as Premier of Queensland, the Governor General said.
What looked to us to be huge risks at the time turned out to be nation building, said Bob Katter, a former minister of Joh's Government, who credited Sir Joh with starting the Queensland coal, aluminum and tourism industries.
He is also remembered for dismantling many of the State's unions, and for a somewhat totalitarian and heavy handed style of keeping control.
Under Joh, street protests were banned and Special Branch monitored extensively those the authoritarian leader saw as subversives, measures prompting Queenslander, Australian Civil Liberties Council, Terry O'Gorman, to comment Sir Joh was the most appalling premier Queensland has ever had in terms of civil liberties and human rights.
Joh was also influential in the famous case of the Dismissal by the Governor General of then-Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, in 1975.
In his last years as Premier, he had taken his cause to the nation's capital, with the Joh for PM campaign.
But this distraction has been credited with the downfall of his government, with corruption investigations at last being conducted by his stand-in, Bill Gunn.
The body of Sir Joh, who was of Lutheran faith, is to be buried at Bethany, the family property near Kingaroy.
Finland now holds the world record for the longest non-stop round of karaoke singing.
The country already holds the record for the largest number of karaoke singers at any given time.
The previous record was 145 hours, as held by China.
However, in a karaoke bar in Kouvola, a small town on Finland's southern coast, the record was surpassed on Wednesday, with the ultimate goal being 240 hours non-stop.
Finns travelled long distances to participate at the event, which was broadcast live on the internet.
The record goes alongside Finland's other record for karaoke, that of the largest number singing at any given time.
This is held by 80,000 fans of the Finnish hard rock band Lordi, who had met in Helsinki for the band to give a brief free concert to celebrate their victory at that year's Eurovision.
The show culminated with all 80,000 joining in with the band on the winning song, Hard Rock Hallelujah.
Hawker, Australian Capital Territory â€” Tonight, the Japanese national team beat the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) softball team 1â€“0 in the first of a two game series before Japan plays a three game test series against the Australian national team.
Japan brought five pitchers to Canberra for their Australian tour.
Since the last Olympics, Japan has been in a rebuilding period.
The side is young and many of their best players have not had much international experience.
One of their best pitchers is only nineteen years old.
The ACT side included Australian national team members Aimee Murch and Clare Warwick; Olympic bronze medalist Brenda De Blaes; Victorian state team representative, national team member and Olympic bronze medalist Justine Smethurst; and Clare Currie, who narrowly missed the cut for the national team.
De Blaes started the top of the first with a hit.
Murch was pitching for the ACT to start the bottom of the first.
Number 15 for Japan opened the inning with a single, and was advanced to third on another single.
She was tagged out after trying to score a run after her teammate hit a pop up caught by the ACT's centre fielder.
Number 6 hit a double during this inning, scoring Japan's only run.
The top of the second saw ACT players 1, 5 and 3 tagged out after hits to the infield.
The bottom of the second saw number 13 out on a foul ball caught on the fly by the ACT's third baseman, and number 11 and 24 out on balls hit into and caught by the ACT's centre fielder.
The top of third inning saw numbers 24 and 21 ground out.
The bottom of the third saw Japan's first batter ground out, number 8 getting a single on an infield hit, another playing getting an out, and the inning ending with number 11 hitting an infield ground out.
The rest of the game followed much the same pattern.
Two players, an ACT player and a Japanese, were struck by balls and required trainers to look at them.
Smethurst came in and pitched a few innings in relief.
Between the fifth and sixth innings, there was a small delay in the game when a dog named Streaker, owned by Australia men's national softball team player Adam Folkard, ran onto the the infield.
An announcement was made at the end of the game that the match scheduled for tomorrow would start fifteen minutes earlier than the advertised start time of 1800.
The Pentagon has confirmed that US forces began an on-going operation of airstrikes in southern Somalia on Monday, and that the attacks, targeted at Islamic militia, are continuing.
Somalia's president had earlier said that the United States was pursuing suspects of the 1998 United States embassy bombings.
It is believed that the militants are sheltering the suspects.
An attack against Ras Kamboni â€” a remote island near the Kenyan border, represents the first American involvement in the tumultuous country since the the 1993 operation that resulted in the deaths of as many as 1,500 Somali militiamen and civilians.
A Somali Defence Ministry official has additionally reported that American helicopters launched an attack against ICU fighters in Afmadow, a city near the Kenyan border, 350 kilometres southwest of Mogadishu.
The AC-130 gunship attack killed an unknown number of civilians, alternatingly reported as 4, 19 or 31.
So far, three people (including a baby) have been killed, and at least ten others were injured when two semi trucks collided in a tunnel on Interstate 5 (Newhall Pass) between Los Angeles and Santa Clarita California, United States in the late evening of October 12, setting off a chain reaction pileup that involved between 28 and 30 semi trucks and one passenger car.
The wreck caused a massive fire that burned for over six hours.
It was previously believed that only 13 semi trucks were involved.
The fire burned in a very intense state for approximately four hours and basically consumed everything that was burnable, said John Tripp the Fire Chief for L.A. county.
As a result of the crash, the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger issued a declaration of a state of emergency for Los Angeles County.
The debris has been removed and officials say that a full inspection will have to be done on the tunnel before it can be used again because the structure of the tunnel has been compromised.
None of the rebar appears to be melted, damaged at this point in time.
But it's completely separated from the walls in a number of areas, so we lose vertical support when that happens, said California Department of Transportation official, Doug Failing.
Tripp added that more bodies could be buried in the wreckage, saying ...we're going to have to do a very methodical search.
There could be unfortunately more people that were not able to escape.
So far authorities have yet to identify the three people who were killed.
A full investigation is being conducted into what caused the crash.
Sparking controversy and eliciting widespread condemnation in an interview with the Washington Post, Pakistan's President, Pervez Musharraf, has made some poorly-judged comments about rape and rape victims.
Musharaff was quoted as having said, Rape has become a money-making concern and he suggested that getting raped was a method of getting a visa to western countries.
The high-profile rape victim, Mukhtar Mai, dismissed the idea that any woman could allow herself to be subjected to such treatment for money.
Her case attracted widespread international media attention with it being alleged that her rape was ordered by the local panchayat (town council).
The United Nations Human Rights Commissioner has questioned Australia's tough asylum seeker policies this week, stating that Australia's mandatory detention regime has cast a shadow over its human rights record.
Navi Pillay, the UN's Human Rights watchdog, was particularly critical of Prime Minister Julia Gillard's asylum seeker trade deal with Malaysia.
This bilateral agreement, if signed, would see 800 refugees attempting to get to Australia by boat immediately transported to Malaysia instead.
In return, Australia would take 4,000 genuine refugees from Malaysia over a space of four years.
However, Malaysia has not signed either the international Refugee Convention, or the Convention Against Torture.
In an interview with the ABC, Ms Pillay voiced concern over this, stating that Australia may violate refugee law by sending asylum seekers to a country where no laws are in place to protect them.
Pillay, a South African former anti-apartheid protester, also voiced distress over the omnipresence of political demonising of these asylum seekers stating, [t]he consequence of the constant political refrain that Australia is being 'flooded' by people who are 'queue jumpers' has resulted in a stigmatisation of an entire group of people, irrespective of where they have come from or what dangers they have fled.
In her six-day trip to Australia, the UN Human Rights Commissioner visited two detention centres and said she was overwhelmed with the grim despondency of asylum seekers, many of whom wait over 18 months to have their case assessed.
The mistreatment of refugees was today reinforced with the release of an Australian Rights Commission report, which revealed extensive problems of self-harm and depression among detainees at the Villawood Detention Centre in Sydney.
The United States Senate has defeated a proposed constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.
The bill was defeated 48 to 49 and did not receive the minimum amount of 60 votes to that would allow the bill to be taken to the full Senate.
The bill fell 18 votes short of the 67 that were needed for approval.
In order for the bill to become part of the U.S. Constitution, this bill would have had to be approved by a two-thirds majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, then be approved by the legislatures of three fourths (that is, 38) of the States.
However, Senator David Vitter, R-LA, who is a supporter of the bill says, we're building votes.
Most Americans are not yet convinced that their elected representatives or the judiciary are likely to expand decisively the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples, said John McCain (R-AZ) who opposed the bill.
A vote for it is a vote against civil unions, against domestic partnership, against all other efforts for states to treat gays and lesbians fairly under the law, said Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy.
The bill would define marriage as between a man and a woman, and would preclude the official recognizing of same-sex marriages.
The bill is expected to be taken back to the Senate in July.
US lawmakers have reached a last-minute deal to avoid a government shutdown, which would have begun at 1200 EDT (0400 UTC) Saturday.
The agreement, announced just one hour before the shutdown was to occur, includes US$38.5 billion in budget reductions.
Earlier on Friday, US legislators deflected claims that a midnight deal was being worked out, but Republican Party sources later reported that a deal was likely to be reached.
The deal was apparently reached after disputes over government funding for organizations such as Planned Parenthood were resolved.
Boehner said both sides decided on a six-day extension, or bridge, of government funding, which would allow Congress to work out a final solution to last the remainder of the 2011 fiscal year, which ends in September.
Voting for the resulting agreement will take place some time next week, according to Boehner.
The last complete US government shutdown occurred in 1995, during the administration of Bill Clinton, lasting five days; it was proceeded by a 21-day partial shutdown.
In the event of a government shutdown, essential federal employees are still required to work, but nonessential personnel are placed on unpaid furloughs.
Essential staff include military personnel, air traffic controllers, emergency officials, and intelligence officials.
In the Philippines, the Liberal Party's presidential candidate Benigno Simeon Cojuangco Aquino III, commonly known as Noynoy, was officially elected as the next President of the Philippines in the 2010 presidential election.
He campaigned for an end to corruption and poverty and says he'll make prosecuting corrupt officials a priority.
Noynoy received more than 15 million votes, about 5.7 million ahead of his closest opponent, ousted Joseph Estrada.
Noynoy said in an interview, I want to lead by example.
I did make a public vow, I will never steal.
Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile told a crowd after the count We have done this ... for the Filipino people â€¦
He is 50 years old, a bachelor, an economics graduate, a Senator and is the only son of former President Corazon Aquino and former Senator Benigno Aquino, Jr..
Noynoy's father was shot while in military custody during the regime of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, before his mother, Corazon Aquino, led the People Power Revolution that toppled Marcos in 1986.
In the Philippines, the president and vice president are elected separately; the Puwersa ng Masang Pilipino Party's vice-presidential candidate Jejomar Cabauatan Binay will become the country's vice-president.
Noynoy is the President-elect, while Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo is the outgoing incumbent.
He will officially become the Philippines's fifteenth president on June 30.
In the 2007 Rugby World Cup, New Zealand overwhelmed tournament newcomers Portugal.
The All Blacks scored more than 100 points and 16 tries in their 108-13 victory to hold their position at the top of Pool C.
A dominant first half display from Australia saw them defeat Wales in Cardiff.
A strong finish by Wales was not enough to prevent the Wallabies, who lead Pool B, winning 32-20 and picking up a bonus point.
Ireland came from behind to defeat a strong Georgian team 14-10 in Pool D. 
Georgia led early in the second half and were threatening to score late in the match but Ireland's defence held to secure the four point victory.
New Zealand, one of the tournament favourites, defeated Portugal by 95 points.
Joe Rokocoko scored two tries to open the scoring for New Zealand.
Isaia Toeava, Ali Williams, Aaron Mauger, Jerry Collins, Chris Masoe and Andrew Hore each added tries as New Zealand ended the half with a 52-3 lead.

France are third with one point from their single match, while Georgia have one point from two defeats.
Two US soldiers killed in Afghanistan yesterday were shot by an Afghan interpreter in Wardek province south-west of Kabul, according to NATO.
An official said the translator shot them at an eastern Afghanistan outpost before he was shot dead by other soldiers.
It is not yet clear why the interpreter started shooting; However, the attacker seemed to be a disgruntled employee, as opposed to a militant, according to a US military official.
The interpreter had supposedly argued with the soldiers over pay and treatment before opening fire.
NATO originally only released a terse statement yesterday, stating that two soldiers and one civilian had been killed.
Elsewhere in Wardek province, four Afghan soldiers died in an airstrike by coalition forces.
It is not thought that the two incidents are related.
NATO called the deaths regrettable and is to carry out an investigation.
The Afghan defence ministry is demanding punishment for the murderers responsible for the airstrike.
The Australian federal and New South Wales governments will not be selling their shares in Snowy Hydro Limited (the owner and operator of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme).
Snowy Hydro Limited's major shareholder is the NSW government with a 58 percent shareholding.
The Victorian government owns 29 percent and the federal government has a 13 percent stake.
NSW Premier Morris Iemma announced in December 2005 that he wished to sell the state's share in Snowy Hydro that caused the federal and Victorian governments to follow.
The proposed sale has attracted immense criticism by those who believed that the sale would affect the environment and water supplies along the Snowy River, this was reinforced yesterday when 58 eminent Australians presented a petition to the government opposing the sale.
Prime Minister John Howard announced today that the federal government would not be selling its 13 percent share of Snowy Hydro following what he calls intense community reaction.
In a statement, Mr Howard said, This decision to sell the Snowy Hydro has created significant unhappiness, concern and unrest throughout the Australian community.
Mr Howard said that the sale was not an election promise by his government and that the federal government failed to see any long-term benefits from the sale.
He also said that the government needed to safeguard the interests of all those dependent on Australia's iconic water resources.
The federal government has however stated that despite refusing to sell its share in Snowy Hydro that it will not be purchasing additional shares if NSW and Victoria push ahead with the sale of their shareholdings.
Despite telling Macquarie Radio earlier this morning that his government would be pushing ahead with the sale as it was in the best interests of NSW, Premier Iemma announced shortly after Mr Howard's release, that the NSW government would be withdrawing its shares from sale.
Mr Iemma conceded that the sale would be extremely difficult with the federal government withdrawing its 13 percent from sale.
The Prime Minister has pulled the rug out from under the sale, Mr Iemma said.
The Commonwealth decision makes it extremely difficult for NSW to proceed, he conceded.
Victoria is yet to announce whether or not it will be withdrawing its shares from sale.
Scientists using NASA's Swift Satellite and other telescopes have observed a supernova in near real time occurring in the constellation of Aries.
The explosion is said to be the most powerful explosion known to scientists, which consists of a gamma-ray burst or an x-ray blast.
Scientists say that bursts signal the beginning of a star's death.
Swift first detected the explosion on February 18 (it was given a designation GRB 060218), which allowed telescopes and satellites to watch the event as it happened.
The blast lasted for more than 2,000 seconds (33 minutes).
This is the type of unscripted event in our nearby universe that we hoped Swift could catch, said Neil Gehrels, Swift principal investigator at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.
Those observations capture the time when the star collapsed, ejected its outer envelope and most of its mass and left a compact remnant behind.
And we think that compact remnant is a neutron star, said an author writing for journal Nature, where the report will be published on Thursday.
Scientists are also planning on using the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory in an attempt to get more images of the event.
The star is at least 440 million light years from Earth.
The group of scientists was led by Sergio Campana of the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics and Alicia Soderberg, a graduate student at Caltech in Pasadena, California.
The primary camera on the Hubble Space Telescope has shut down and is likely to only be restored to partial functionality, according to reports from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
The camera on the telescope, known as the Advanced Camera for Surveys or ACS, can be reactivated but will be restored to only one-third of its operating capacity.
The camera shut down over the weekend, probably due to a failure of its backup power supply.
It was the third such shutdown of the camera in the past calendar year.
The camera had been operating on its backup power since June 30, 2006, when engineers switched from the primary power supply (Side A) to the backup (Side B) due to a malfunction.
A review board was convened on January 29 to assess all options and to decide on a course of action.
Their findings will be reported to NASA on March 2, 2007.
The ACS, developed jointly by four American agencies, was installed in March of 2002.
It is a system of three cameras, filters, and dispersers which act to detect wavelengths of light ranging from near-infrared to ultraviolet.
It is a system that was designed to last five years, according to Preston Burch, associate director and program manager for the Hubble Space Telescope.
NASA also indicated that the other four main systems on the telescope remain unaffected and functioning normally.
A scheduled mission to the space telescope in 2008 is expected to deliver instruments to further upgrade the capabilities of the telescope.
It is not known what the effect of the ACS failure will have on the scheduled mission.
Burch said in a press release posted on the NASA main website, It is important that the review board conduct a thorough investigation that will allow us to determine if there are any changes needed in the new instruments that will be installed on the upcoming servicing mission so that we can be sure of maximizing the telescope's scientific output.
We are continuing to make excellent progress in our preparations for the servicing mission, which is presently targeted to fly in September 2008.
One day after France began enforcing a ban on the public wearing Islamic veils that cover the face, either a niqÄb or a burqa, French police briefly detained two veiled women.
The police later claimed that the women were arrested for taking part in an unauthorized protest, not because they were wearing veils.
The women were arrested while outside the famed Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, and may now face fines of up to $217 (150 euros), community service andor a citizenship course under the law.
While the ban covers the burqa and the niqÄb, it does not include the hijab or the chador.
The hijab is a veil that leaves the face visible while covering the hair and neck, and the chador covers only the body.
The law has stirred much debate, both in France and around the globe.
Those who oppose the new law say it limits freedom of speech and freedom of religion, while supporters claim that women are degraded by wearing veils and the law is intended to empower those women, as well as increase public security.
The French government, in defense of the ban, said that it was necessary because wearing veils falls short of the living standards in France and and makes women be of an lower status in a country where everybody is considered equal.
French Prime Minister Francois Fillon has said that the ban is consistent with the national values of France.
The French Republic lives in a bare-headed fashion, he said in a statement published by a government newspaper.
The French government previously made efforts to accommodate Muslims in the country, including establishing a council dealing with the presence of Islam; however, according to Amer Sahar, a professor who studies the topic, some Muslims in the country say that they feel as though they are under assault by the government.
She said that some are resentful of the fact that they are not allowed to be both Muslim and French.
The French government is also concerned with women and children who are forced to veil themselves.
It has said that such an action is a new form of enslavement that the republic cannot accept on its soil.
Activist Rachid Nekkaz auctioned one of his homes to provide money to pay the fine for any woman arrested under the law.
I would like to send a clear message to President Nicolas Sarkozy that we can do what we want.
We have a constitution and everyone has to respect it, he said.
According to the French Constitutional Council, the law conforms to the Constitution because it does not limit the freedom of religion or excessively punish people for exercising that right in a place of worship.
A controversial patent directive has been thrown out in a landslide vote.
648 MEPs out of 680 voted today to reject the proposal, aimed at bringing Europe in-line with a similar U.S. bill.
This is a great victory for those who have campaigned to ensure that European innovation and competitiveness is protected from monopolisation of software functionalities and business methods.
It marks the end of an attempt by the European Commission and governmental patent officials to impose detrimental and legally questionable practices of the European Patent Office (EPO) on the member states, said the Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure, in opposition to the directive.
Adversaries to the patent directive claim that a bill covering Intellectual Property (IP) would stifle innovation in Europe, as it allows the patenting of implementation within software.
Many anti-patent activists say that if the bill were passed, small businesses and hobbyists would be in danger of lawsuit from corporations and their extensive patent portfolios.
United States President Barack Obama is seeking a comprehensive exit strategy from the Afghanistan war.
During a 60 Minutes interview, Obama said, There's got to be an exit strategy.
There's got to be a sense that this is not perpetual drift.
In February Obama said that 17,000 more troops would be sent this year before the August elections to supplement the 36,000 American troops already deployed in Afghanistan.
Obama stated that the U.S. Mission in Afghanistan is making sure that al-Qaeda cannot attack the U.S. homeland and U.S. interests and our allies.
Options for a strategy include improving Afghan-Pakistani relations, while rebuilding Afghanistan's economy.
I found a very encouraging symmetry of views between our NATO allies and other troop-contributing countries and the United States, Richard Holbrooke, U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan stated.
In the past, the United States government stove-piped it, they had an Afghan policy and a Pakistan policy.
We have to integrate the two and I hope the rest of the world will join us in that effort, said Holbrooke.
Obama also said that the complexities of Afghanistan are matched, maybe even dwarfed, by the complexities of the economic situation.
There needs to be a way to withdraw from Afghanistan and place the focus on economic growth.
We may need to bring a more regional diplomatic approach to bear.
We may need to coordinate more effectively with our allies.
But we can't lose sight of what our central mission is.
European allies have stated they have exit plans for the next three to four years.
Hamid Karzai, the Afghan President says that although he supports the idea, he urges that there is no need for any quick fixes.
Representative Tom Tancredo (R-CO) has clarified his earlier statement that you could take out their holy sites, in the event of a nuclear attack upon the U.S. by Islamic terrorists.
Rep. Tancredo has refused to make any apologies, saying When we bombed Hiroshima, when we bombed Dresden, we punished a lot of people who were not necessarily (guilty).
Not every German was a member of the Nazi Party.
However, Tancredo emphasized that he was speaking hypothetically and not necessarily suggesting policy.
The remarks, made in a July 15th radio interview, hosted by Pat Campbell of WFLA in Orlando, Florida, have drawn support from conservatives groups such as Northeast Intelligence Network and Free Republic, and have offended the American Muslim community.
Veteran White House journalist Helen Thomas, 89, announced her retirement yesterday with immediate effect, ending her fifty-seven year career, amid criticism over controversial remarks.
Thomas has been a correspondent for over fifty years and has covered every president from John F. Kennedy to Obama.
Thomas, the daughter of Lebanese immigrants, who blazed a trail for female reporters in politics in the United States, has ended her career after apologizing for saying that Israel should get the hell out of Palestine.
In retiring, Thomas stated I deeply regret my comments I made last week regarding the Israelis and the Palestinians.
They do not reflect my heart-felt belief that peace will come to the Middle East only when all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance.
Her departure as Hearst Newspaper columnist was announced after she was captured on video saying Remember, these people are occupied and it's their land.
It's not Germany, it's not Poland, and that Israelis should get the hell out of Palestine and they should go home to Poland, Germany, the US and everywhere else.
Rabbi David Nesenoff, an independent filmmaker, said he spoke to Thomas outside the White House on Jewish Heritage Day on May 27.
Video of her controversial comments were widely disseminated on the Internet by his website, rabbilive.com, that relaunched last week.
She was dropped by her public speaking agency and a high school commencement address was canceled.
The Hearst statement came shortly after White House press secretary Robert Gibbs called her remarks offensive and reprehensible.
Thomas has been a correspondent for fifty-seven years, she had worked for decades as a White House correspondent for United Press International and became a columnist for the Hearst newspaper chain in recent years.
She was the first female officer of the National Press Club, the first female member and president of the White House Correspondents Association, and, in 1975, the first female member of the Gridiron Club.
Thomas did little to hide her views, with her questions to Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama and their press secretaries often about the wars in the Middle East.
Two weeks ago, she asked Obama, Mr. President, when are you going to get out of Afghanistan 
Why are you continuing to kill and die there
What is the real excuse
 And don't give us this Bushism, 'If we don't go there, they'll all come here.'
During Kennedy's administration, Helen ended all presidential press conferences with a signature Thank you, Mr. President and always issued a caveat about her work In my career you're only as good as your last story.
Police in Austria have reported that the situation in the cellar where people were illegally imprisoned for over two decades is 'oppressive'.
They have also said that they cannot stay in the cellar for more than one hour.
AP reported that this is because there is a low oxygen level in the cellar.
This announcement by the police comes after police in the Lower Austrian town of Amstetten arrested a 73 year old man who is alleged to have kept his daughter, now aged 42, locked in the cellar of his house in Amstetten since August 29, 1984.
The man, identified by police as Josef Fritzl, is alleged to have started sexually abusing his daughter, named as Elisabeth Fritzl, when she was eleven years old, and to have subsequently fathered seven children by her.
One of the children, one of a set of twins born in 1996, died of neglect shortly after birth and the body was burned by the father.
The surviving six children, three boys and three girls, are currently aged between 5 and 20 years old.
Three of the children were left on Josef F.'s doorstep and subsequently raised as the adoptive children of Josef F. and his wife, Rosemarie, while the other three children were left with their mother and never saw daylight until she was discovered.
Rosemarie F. is said to have been unaware of her husbands' activities.
Police became suspicious when a 19-year-old daughter, Kerstin, was taken to hospital with a mysterious life-threatening illness, and the family's medical records were checked.
Police say that Elisabeth F. appeared to be greatly disturbed psychologically, and only agreed to talk after the authorities assured her that she would not have to have contact with her father, and that her children would be cared for.
The local authorities have recently released a statement regarding these incidents, an English translation of part of which is available below
The news has shocked Austria, as has its similarity to the case of Natascha Kampusch who was kidnapped aged 10, and escaped after being held in a dungeon for eight years in 2006.
The first charges under the new U.K. International Criminal Court Act have been brought against seven British servicemen.
The charges relate to the mistreatment of civilians and the death of Baha Mousa (26) a hotel receptionist in Basra in 2003.
The charges include manslaughter, inhumane treatment, causing actual bodily harm, and common assault of Iraqi civilians.
A Warrant Officer and a Major in the British Intelligence Corps and the former commander of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment (now the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment) are charged with negligently performing duties.
The first British serviceman to give evidence, a senior aircraftsman in the RAF, testified that he saw prisoners with bags over their heads being kicked and verbally abused.
He said that he had never seen anything like it before and didn't know what to do.
He had not intervened because they (the soldiers) were bigger than me, and I didn't know what their orders were.
The court martial at the Military Court Centre, Bulford Camp, Wiltshire continues.
Two British soldiers were killed in Afghanistan on Wednesday, with one being the highest ranking British officer to be killed in 30 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Rupert Thorneloe, 40, Commanding Officer of the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, and Trooper Joshua Hammond, 18, of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment, were killed when an improvised explosive device was detonated under their Viking armoured vehicle.
They had been travelling along the Shamalan Canal, near Lashkar Gah in Helmand Province, on their way to resupply an offensive underway currently against the Taliban.
General Sir Richard Dannatt, the UK Chief of the General Staff, said Thornloe was an outstanding commanding officer.
In a Ministry of Defence (MoD) statement, Dannatt said, [Thornloe's] courageous, thoughtful stewardship of 1st Battalion Welsh Guards since October last year has seen them superbly prepared for the demands of Afghanistan, both in terms of their professional capability and their unbreakable spirit as a team.
Trooper Hammond, Danntt said in the MoD statement, was a first class tank crewman who epitomised the spirited and determined approach to operations expected of Royal Armoured Corps soldiers.
Lieutenant Colonel Thorneloe is survived by his wife, Sally, and daughters Hannah and Sophie.
IBM's T.J. Watson Research Center in Cambridge released a free tool March 25 for visualizing the changing history of a document or directory of documents, called history flow.
The tool offers a variety of views of document histories, including a view that gives each revision equal importance, and a timeline view which displays each revision proportionally to how long it remained current.
Each different editor who makes changes to the article has a distinct color, allowing for that editor's text to be tracked over time.
The tool was first developed in 2003 by a collaboration between Fernanda B. ViÃ©gas of the MIT Media Lab and Martin Wattenberg and Kushal Dave of IBM.
It was initially tested out on a large subset of the pages of Wikipedia, a free online encyclopedia project which preserves every change made to each of its articles.
The resulting paper was drafted in the winter of 2003 and presented at a conference in April 2004; it remains the most comprehensive overview of the lifecycle of articles in an active wiki community.

Republican candidates for President of the United States Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry have failed to qualify to be on the ballot for the Virginia primary election, scheduled for March 6, Super Tuesday.
Gingrich, former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and Perry, Governor of Texas, did not submit the 10,000 signatures, with at least 400 from each of the state's eleven congressional districts, to the state's board of elections before the 500 PM deadline last Thursday required to gain ballot access, according to the Republican Party of Virginia.
Gingrich's and Perry's campaigns both claimed to have more signatures than needed, 11,050 and 11,911 respectively.
Volunteers spent last night reviewing the submitted petitions and validating signatures.
Reportedly Rick Perry is considering an appeal of the assessment.
Among other major candidates for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney and Texas congressman Ron Paul submitted the required petition and qualified for the ballot.
On Thursday, it was disclosed that candidates Michele Bachmann and Rick Santorum also failed to gain ballot access.
According to the manager of the Gingrich campaign, Michael Krull, the former House Speaker plans to compete in the Virginia primary, despite not gaining ballot access, as a write-in candidate.
Krull blamed a failed system for the campaign's inability to gain ballot access.
Rick Perry's campaign manager said he was disappointed by that campaign's failure to qualify for the ballot.
According to a recent poll of 489 Republican voters by Quinnipiac University, Gingrich leads in the state with 30% of support, followed by Mitt Romney at 25% and Ron Paul at 9%.
As Virginia's delegates to the Republican National Convention are not awarded on a winner-take-all basis, candidates other than the winner of the state's primary could also gain delegates from the state.
North Korea's official news agency is reporting that the country has finished removing all its spent nuclear fuel rods, over 8,000 of them, from the main reactor in the Yongbyon nuclear plant.
The rods could be reprocessed for several months to extract weapons-grade plutonium.
Officials say the rods could be able to provide enough plutonium to make two nuclear bombs.
This could possibly signal that North Korea is preparing for a nuclear arms test.
North Korea may already have enough materials to make six nuclear bombs.
North Korea has also announced plans to continue operating the Yongbyon facility, as well as to begin construction on a larger reactor.

Renault driver Fernando Alonso won the FIA Formula-1 2006 Fuji Television Japanese Grand Prix on the Suzuka International Racing Course.
Though Ferrari drivers Felipe Massa and Michael Schumacher started the race from the first row, Alonso managed to overtake both Toyotas on the first part of the race and Massa after the pit stops.
Then Alonso started to push on Michael Schumacher and closed the gap to about 5 seconds.
An engine failure forced Schumacher to park his car after the tunnel on lap 36 and the Spaniard rushed to his seventh victory in this season.
Giancarlo Fisichella, Fernando's teammate, had a bad start, but burst through Toyota and finished on the back of the second-placed Filipe Massa.
Toyota drivers Jarno Trulli and Ralf Schumacher lost even more positions, when Honda driver Jenson Button and McLaren Mercedes driver Kimi RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen slipped in front of them and finished on 4-th and 5-th place respectively.
The situation in the drivers' championship became almost critical for Schumacher, who lost 10 points this week-end.
Only one chance remains for Schumacher to win his eighth champion's title - if he wins the final 2006 Brazilian Grand Prix and Alonso doesn't score any points.
I have to say clearly I don't really believe in the championship anymore, was Schumacher's reaction.
There remains a battle for the third place in drivers' championship, where Massa has a one point lead ahead of Fisichella.
In the constructor's championship Renault is 9 points ahead of Ferrari.
A circus elephant managed to escape from her handler on Sunday night in the city of Zurich, Switzerland before being recaptured by local police and circus animal keepers.
The 26-year-old female elephant, named Sabu, is from Switzerland's Zirkus Knie.
She was able to make her escape just before being put into a trailer, while the keeper was not paying attention.
Around 1930 local time (1730 UTC), Sabu was seen wading in Lake Zurich for a short time before walking back onto city streets.
Zurich police said that Sabu wandered along the Bahnhofstrasse avenue of Zurich, which is known as the city's most exclusive shopping street.
She also passed by ZÃ¼rich Hauptbahnhof (the city's main rail station) and Paradeplatz, a square of Bahnhofstrasse, where both Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS AG have headquarters.
For nearly an hour, police chased the elephant around the city before she was finally peacefully recaptured in the Talstrasse section of Zurich.
Circus officials and police followed Sabu, but a circus spokesperson said that she did not respond to their calls.
Sabu was also said to have been moving so fast that police had difficulty keeping up with her.
At about 2000 local time (1900 UTC), a keeper was able to control the animal and load her onto a truck to take her to Winterthur, where the other circus animals were.
There were no reports of any damage or injuries during the incident, and although police held back onlookers, at least one bystander managed to capture video of the event.
The circus said that Sabu may have escaped after being frightened by storms near Zurich.
After returning to the circus, she was said to be tired, but pleased to be back.

Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas spookesman said that there is no date for talks with South Africa yet.

Israeli foreign ministry spokesman voiced his ministry's concerns that giving legitimacy to an unreformed Hamas could turn the movement from a terrorist organization to a political party.
Gary Bettman, the NHL commissioner, today announced that the 20042005 season of the National Hockey League has been canceled.
The announcement served only as official comfirmation of what was generally expected as wild speculation had raged during the past few days.
The dispute centered around player pay caps, which where staunchly opposed by the players.

This will be the first year since 1919 that the Stanley Cup - the top prize in the NHL - will not be awarded.
That year, a flu epidemic forced the finals to be called off.

We have a very good recruiting policy and anybody who passes the muster for our recruiting policy we'd be glad to offer a job to, provided he's old enough to hold a driver's license, Yarra Trams Deputy Chief Executive, Dennis Cliche, told Australian Associated Press on Monday.
